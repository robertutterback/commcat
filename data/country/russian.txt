To avoid international sanctions or reduce their negative impact, Russian companies need to integrate more actively into the world economy, said the rector of the Russian Academy of National Economy and Public Administration (RANEPA) Vladimir Mau, quoted by TASS.
 
As an example, he cited the situation around the companies of businessman Oleg Deripaska. At first they came under US sanctions, but then Washington agreed to withdraw them in exchange for fulfilling certain conditions. The most important of them is the transfer of control over the business from Deripaska to independent shareholders. According to Mau, this is due to the fact that the products of the companies of the entrepreneur, primarily aluminum produced by Rusal , are in demand in the West.
 
“What Deripaska’s history has shown: the more a company or economy is integrated into international trade and international economic relations, the more difficult it is to impose sanctions on them. This story has shown that integration into the global economy is effective in terms of protecting our interests. And practice confirms this, ”said Mau.
 
He also referred to the experience of China. In 1989, the then country's leader, Deng Xiaoping, did not respond to the sanctions imposed against Beijing with mirror measures, but decided to liberalize the market. “Active, even aggressive export development has begun, with long-term, extremely positive effects. Now it is difficult to impose sanctions on China, they are being replaced by trade wars, and this is a completely different story, ”said the economist.
 
According to him, the state needs to carry out systematic work, which will not be limited to the introduction of response measures to foreign restrictions.

In such a situation, it is important to clearly assess the long-term prospects of the market and companies, to continue to maintain and even increase the level of investment in the real sector, ”Novak stated in this regard.

The crisis continues in relations between Russia and the United States: the year 2018 did not justify hope, the situation only worsened. To understand how to restore the relations of the two countries, against whom Moscow and Washington will be friends, and against whom they don’t, and what is the purpose of the sanctions imposed by the Americans, Lenta.ru talked with the director of the Center for Military-Political Analysis at the Hudson Institute, an expert of the Valdai Club by Richard Weitz.
 
Lenta.ru : It is obvious that Russian-American relations are currently in crisis. Do you think that Russia and the United States are historical rivals, and always will be?
 
Richard Weitz : No , I don’t think we are doomed to a cold war. We had periods of good relations, there were periods of bad ones. I believe that relations can improve - this is evident, for example, from public opinion polls ... There will not be big changes in the next few years, but in the long term they are quite possible.
 
How can we trigger these changes? What is the first step?
 
We need a new treaty on Ukraine. This is the main problem, the main source of voltage. Restarting this process is very important for lifting the sanctions. Then, in the long term, the establishment of cooperation and business ties. But all this will take time. Perhaps, this will require two other presidents - it is unlikely that President Trump and President Putin will indeed be able to change the relations of our countries. They may want, but the political situation does not allow. Maybe a new generation of leaders will be easier. But, I repeat, it will not be soon.
 
Do you still think that success in negotiations on issues such as Ukraine and Syria could lead to a reset of relations?
 
Until we solve them, nothing will happen. Then, perhaps, it will be possible to achieve progress, but certainly not in the next two years. To fix everything, it takes time.
 
You say that to change the dynamics may require a new president. However, Ed Royce, head of the foreign affairs committee of the House of Representatives, said that the main problem was one president: Vladimir Putin.No matter who will be the president of the United States, he will demand the return of the Crimea and so on. Do you think that it is Putin who is the main obstacle?
 
Putin, of course, is not popular in Congress, and this complicates cooperation with Russia. Remember Medvedev: when he was president - even if formally - the relationship was easier to build. Putin returned - again complicated. This is the first problem. But the second is Trump. It is difficult for him to “sell” the improvement of relations with Russia to Congress. If someone else was in his place, everything would be different.

It's all about the future, but what about our day? Now we have sanctions - will they be lifted? Will they force Russia to return the Crimea to Ukraine?
 
Sanctions have many tasks, and only one of them is to make Russia change the political course. There are several other goals: to limit the amount of resources that Russia can spend on its military-industrial complex, to convince other countries not to cooperate with it, and to show American citizens that the United States is not slowing down pressure on Russia.
 
So even if they do not affect the policy of Russia, they can be useful. That is why it will not be easy to remove them - for this you will need real progress in bilateral relations. I will say this: sanctions will not force Russia to change behavior, but a change of behavior will force sanctions to change or completely disappear.
 
The Russian authorities have declared that the period of global domination of the USA is over. Do you think the United States agrees? What is your personal rating?
 
It is obvious that in the United States do not agree with her - neither the government nor the ordinary Americans. But we must look specifically: firstly, military power and active operations in the international arena make the United States the dominant military actor. Secondly, culture: Hollywood is still extremely powerful. Thirdly, the economy: the United States is more influential than any other country in the world, but still they cannot impose decisions on the whole world alone. And in other areas, and in solving global problems - for example, in the fight against terrorism and climate change - the United States cannot achieve the desired results on its own, they need international cooperation.
 
That is, we are approaching the end of global domination, but still far from it?
 
True, but only in some areas. In addition, we are approaching very slowly: the United States does not slide into the abyss, it is not a quick and completely reversible process. Russia is much more unstable in this regard: in the 90s it was not a major player, but then restored influence, restored the economy.
 
China is also growing, increasing influence, but this too can change dramatically! This has already happened in Chinese history. Yes, the US influence is gradually weakening, and this process continues. But there will be changes — there is no doubt about that.

By the way, about China: President Trump said that tense relations with the United States encourage Russia and China to cooperate. Do you think Russia and the United States can jointly oppose China? What would it give Russia?
 
I see no reasons that could give Russia a reason to unite with the United States against China. When Trump was just chosen, it was possible to dream, but not now: no matter what Trump suggested, the next president will be able to cancel it. It is perfectly reasonable that the Russians do not understand why they should be drawn into the confrontation with China. The power in the PRC is stable, you do not expect surprises from it.
 
China has a similar position: why should it oppose Russia? The United States, again, is unlikely to be able to do something to set Moscow and Beijing against each other. In the future, the conflict between the two countries can still be imagined, but now they are too economically connected. In general, in the short term, their conflict is most likely impossible.
 
Do you think that it would be reasonable for Russia to take precautions now against China - to prepare for a confrontation in order to avoid surprises?
 
Of course! Moreover, I think that Russia is taking these measures and is preparing for a confrontation with China - it simply does not speak about it. It would be strange if Moscow did not do this. But Russia hardly believes that the threat from China will arise in the next ten years - so it is most likely a question of preparing for a fairly distant future. Because the Chinese authorities are unlikely to change: it is likely that in the future they will have someone like another Xi Jinping.
 
Usually the countries gaining strength behave aggressively - remember Germany or Japan. The Chinese act more gracefully - they do not take away the islands directly. But their approach may change.
 
A serious obstacle to the restoration of Russian-American relations may be the fact that many Russians consider American policy to be two-faced - Russia is punished for violinist Poison, although its guilt is not formally proven, while Saudi Arabia is not punished for the murder of Jamal Hashkoudzhi, although its guilt already fully confirmed. Do you agree with the fact that the United States takes the controversial position that Russia is right here?
 
I see it this way: Russia is perceived at a different level. When you think about Russia, it is still perceived as any other European country. It should be compared with Germany or France, so I believe that in some moments it could cope better. For other countries - some Asian countries, for example - the attitude is different, and the standards are lower. Russia has the potential, it should be like Germany, Britain and other European liberal democracies.
 
You want to say that the US government seriously holds this point of view?
 
This is my opinion - Russia should be assessed according to higher standards.
 
And what is the opinion of the US authorities?
 
It is ambiguous. President Trump, for example, looks more at bilateral economic ties — if not, he is ready to punish countries for misbehavior, but will not do this with our partners. But this, again, his personal assessment.Those who attach great importance to human rights will criticize all countries equally, in spite of our cooperation in the economic and security spheres.
 
You mentioned that terrorism is one of the main threats. It is followed by Iran ...
 
Well, that's Trump's point of view. He thinks so.
 
Okay, China is hard, but what about Iran? Could Russia sacrifice its relationship with Iran to help the United States?
 
Yes. I think it's possible. Moreover, this has already happened when Russia refused to sell S-300 systems to Iran. In general, Russia can break with Iran - the situation is not the same as with China. The probability of this is lower than a few years ago, but it still remains - for example, in the case of a restart of Russian-American relations.

You talked about the main threats according to Trump. What do you see as the main threats to the United States?
 
I agree with his assessment, it is reasonable. The threat of terrorism has somewhat weakened lately, Iran still interferes with the interests of the United States, relations between the United States and Russia will improve over time - besides, I think the leaders will not allow anything bad to happen.
 
And I’m worried about relations with China. There are many unknown factors in them: a lot can go wrong and lead to a crisis, which we will not be able to pay, unlike, for example, the crisis in US-Russian relations. So this is a major concern.
 
Why is it possible to put an end to the crisis in the American-Russian relations, but not in the American-Chinese relations? What is there between Russia and the United States that is not between the United States and China?
 
Russia and the United States must be partners. But China and the United States ... It is possible to imagine how we become adversaries. Relations with Russia someday will be better - they have nowhere to deteriorate, I say this every year ...
 
But they are getting worse.
 
Yes. But they will definitely get better.

IN 2014, THE REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA SIGNED AN AGREEMENT ON ASSOCIATION AND ON FREE TRADE WITH THE EU. CITIZENS PROMISED ECONOMIC GROWTH, ACCESSIBILITY OF EUROPEAN MARKETS AND ACTIVE TRADE.
 
As a result, what is the economy of the Republic of Moldova built on today, has the export of goods to the EU countries grown, is the Moldovan manufacturer protected?
 
- Our economy is built on imports and consumption. But we will not last so long. We need to focus it on production and export. We need different markets, but we should not lose the traditional markets. When Moldova signed the Association and Free Trade Agreement with the EU, no one thought: how should the country continue to live, how to develop economically, with whom will we trade?
 
Today they say that we have an increase in exports to EU countries. And, according to statistics, there really is growth. But what do we export? Exports of sunflower seeds increased threefold, while imports of sunflower oil increased ninefold! Where did we leave the extra cost?
 
Of course, Europe can open the gates very wide, but the EU will always protect its producers. And it is right. We have to think how to protect our producers. Another example: last year, despite the sanctions, thanks to the efforts of our president, 230 thousand tons of apples were exported to Russia, and as many as 6 thousand tons were exported to EU countries.
 
At the same time imported
 
9 thousand tons Unfortunately, the government does not think about it.

The Russian billionaire, owner of the Renova investment group, Viktor Vekselberg, was expelled from the Board of Trustees of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Radio Liberty reports.
 
The MIT explained that the businessman was expelled from the board of trustees soon after the US Treasury published a list of Russian oligarchs against whom sanctions would be applied.
 
As noted in the publication, excluding the entrepreneur, MIT wants to protect itself from legal risks. The Institute elected Vekselberg to the Board of Trustees in 2013.
 
At the end of last year, Vekselberg filed a petition to the US authorities with a request to cancel the sanctions imposed on him in April 2018. The document was handed over to OFAC, a division of the US Treasury that monitors compliance with sanctions.

A storm warning
How to escape from the global crisis and not lose the last money in 2019

By the end of 2018, the global economy began to show signs of a slowdown. Stock markets rolled down, and economists spoke loudly about the end of a record long period of growth. The main word of the coming year is “uncertainty”, it is to her that most analysts polled complain, and it is she who is the cause of panic and sharp fluctuations in the markets: investors do not know where to hide their money. For ordinary citizens, the instability of the world economy is also an alarming bell - after all, the ruble exchange rate, the rise in prices and the state of Russian wallets depend on external factors. What will happen to the ruble, inflation, and how not to lose your savings - Lenta.ru presents a consensus forecast for 2019.
 
Sure fall
For ordinary Russians, the ruble exchange rate is almost the main indicator of the state of the national economy: if the ruble falls, then everything is bad, it grows - it means that the economy returns to stability. In 2019, the Russian currency will continue to depend on traditional external factors, namely, world energy prices and sanctions rhetoric of western countries. The chief analyst at BCS Premier, Anton Pokatovich, suggests that by the end of the first quarter of 2019, after the end of the sanction period, a new wave of sanctions against Russia will take place in the West. He expects the US authorities to limit the purchase of Russian assets by foreign investors, as well as payments for some Russian banks.
 
Egor Susin, head of Gazprombank’s strategy development center, believes that in general, 2019 will be a year of great risks, and the main influence on the ruble exchange rate will not be on oil prices, but on capital flows and Bank of Russia actions. A sharp drawdown of the Russian ruble is awaited by the Deputy Director of the Analytical Department of Alpari, Natalya Milchakova, in her opinion, by the end of 2019, the dollar will cost 73 rubles. "The increase in VAT, the growth of tariffs on housing and utilities and excise taxes from the beginning of the year will disperse inflation and strengthen the tendency of the ruble to weaken," she said.
 
MATERIALS BY TOPIC
00:04 - January 10, 2018
 
Sober head
What will happen to the ruble, oil prices and Bitcoin in 2018
Dmitry Kharlampiev, director of analytics at Otkritie Bank, turned out to be the main optimist; he believes that, despite all the negative factors, the average annual exchange rate of the ruble against the dollar may be in the region of 65 rubles. In his opinion, this is possible with the restoration of Brent oil prices to above $ 65 per barrel thanks to the implementation of the OPEC + agreement in the first half of the year.
 
John Hardy, chief currency strategist at the Danish investment bank Saxo Bank, believes that if global markets do not recover in the near future, the US economy will weaken, and due to this the dollar will lose in value, the rate will fall "well below 70 rubles per dollar." At the same time, the euro will significantly strengthen its position against the dollar and will cost 85 rubles already. Hardy makes a bet on the euro, predicting the highest rate of the European currency, but Natalia Milchakova predicts the minimum value of the euro, in her opinion, the euro for the year will be in the range of 71-80 rubles.
 
Last year, investors overestimated the stability of the Russian currency. The forecast of Gazprombank turned out to be the closest to reality. It laid the upper limit of the dollar price at 65 rubles, the representative of Otkritie Broker farthest from reality with a forecast in the range of 53-58 rubles per dollar. Nobody expected that a dollar by the end of 2018 will cost around 69.5 rubles.
 
Consensus forecast for 2019: the dollar will cost 68.2 rubles, the euro - 81.16 rubles.
 
The end of optimism
The key rate of the Central Bank determines at what price commercial banks can get a loan from a regulator - the higher the rate, the more “expensive” the money - they are harder to get. The entire financial market and the availability of money in the economy, including the consumer credit sector, depend on the rate. Last year, all experts expected a rate cut, some to 7 percent. The forecasts did not materialize; by the end of 2018, the rate was 7.75 percent per annum. “The fact that the key rate returned to the level of 2017 suggests that the economy should say goodbye to its positive expectations on the value of money,” said Natalya Orlova, chief economist at Alfa Bank.
 
Elvira Nabiullina

Now, the mood of experts has changed, and almost everyone expects that the head of the Bank of Russia, Elvira Nabiullina, will continue to raise rates in 2019. The only non-conformist is John Hardy from Saxo Bank. He suggests that the Central Bank may reduce the key rate to 7 percent. However, as he made a reservation, if oil prices fall significantly, the Central Bank may have to keep the intention to lower the rate. The main part of the experts, on the contrary, thinks that the nearest rate increase awaits us already at the first meeting of the Board of Directors of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, which will be held in February, after which it will not change.
 
The most conservative forecast was given by the Deputy Director of the Analytical Department of Alpari, Natalya Milchakova, at 8.5 percent in 2019. Last year, none of the analysts surveyed by Lentoy.ru could correctly name the key rate at the end of 2018. All experts expected a further decline, most predicted a rate of 7 percent. The lowest rate, 5.75 percent, was predicted by Saxo Bank.
 
Consensus forecast for the key rate at the end of 2019: 7.87 percent per annum.

The main factors that will spur inflation in 2019 are the increase in VAT, the increase in utility tariffs and the increase in excise taxes. “The increase in all kinds of excise taxes, taxes and fees after 2014, which has led to a decline in business activity of domestic companies, and expensive loans and a devalued ruble put Russian business operating in the domestic market on the verge of profitability, forcing enterprises to take the path of cost optimization to develop new projects, ”says Sergey Drozdov, an analyst at Finam. He expects that inflation can “approach the double-digit mark,” which is the most negative prediction of our forecast.

Stanislav Murashov, Raiffeisenbank macroanalyst, expects that “the response to the VAT increase will not be as dramatic as the Central Bank predicts.” In his opinion, inflation will pass the peak in the first quarter of 2019, and then begin to decline steadily due to weak demand. Geldy Soyunov, chief analyst at Alfa-Bank, also believes that after the acceleration of inflation in the first quarter, it will decline further and drop to 4.2 percent by the end of the year - this is the most optimistic forecast among those polled by Lentoi.ru Analysts.
 
Last year, the inflation rate was most accurately predicted in the BCS. Following the results of 2018, the rise in prices in Russia was 4.3 percent, while BCS analysts relied on 4.25 percent. A year ago, pessimistic were set up at VTB Capital, suggesting that inflation would reach 5.2 percent, and representatives of Gazprombank, who expected 3.5 percent inflation, surrendered to excessive optimism.
 
Consensus on inflation forecast for 2019: 4.8 percent.
 
Oil mist
The situation on the oil market remains unpredictable, so some analysts refused to give specific estimates. “Now I have stopped making forecasts for 2019, the future is very vague, considering that the market is“ taken hostage ”by the trade war between the US and China, geopolitics, changes in short-term rates in the US, the US dollar and, not least, Donald Trump” , - said Ole Hansen, head of Saxo Bank's strategy department at the commodity and raw materials market.

Sergey Drozdov, an analyst at Finam, believes that the slowdown in global GDP growth expected in 2019 due to the trade conflict between Washington and Beijing will provoke a wave of withdrawal of capital from emerging markets and will put pressure on oil prices that could fall below $ 50 per barrel.

The US is taking over the oil market. Russia will be difficult to fight for high prices
Vasilisa Baranova, an analyst of the sovereign ratings and ACRA forecasting group, believes that the likelihood of the oil market shocks on the supply side is high. “For example, in the second half of 2019, commissioning pipeline facilities in the United States could contribute to a significant decrease in oil prices,” she says. Anton Pokatovich, the main analyst of BCS Premier, turned out to be the main optimist; in his opinion, prices in the oil market in 2019 could recover amid the OPEC + transaction to the level of $ 73-75 per barrel.
 
The fall in oil prices in 2018 to $ 52.8 per barrel (data as of December 29) was an unpleasant surprise for analysts. A year ago, none of the analysts polled by Tape.ru expected such a decline. Most experts assumed that, due to US pressure, oil would be at $ 60 per barrel. The closest was the Alpari forecast - $ 56 per barrel.
 
The consensus forecast for oil at the end of 2019: the cost of a barrel of Brent brand will be $ 65.27.
 
Better not to risk
A year ago, the whole world was shocked by the record growth of the crypto market, in this, on the contrary, Bitcoin for the year collapsed from almost 20 thousand dollars to four. The fate of the main cryptocurrency of the planet, Russian analysts are afraid to predict. The head of Gazprombank’s strategy development center, Yegor Susin, believes that Bitcoin will continue to search for its niche in the modern financial system.
 
“Changes in world finances indicate that such a niche will be formed, but not the fact that it is Bitcoin that can take it. For the most part, the bubble in the cryptocurrency market has already collapsed, interest in this market in 2019 may return again, but it is meaningless to predict any price levels in this market due to its low level of development, ”he believes. Yaroslav Lisovolik, the head of Sberbank Investment Research, in turn, believes that the high volatility of Bitcoin is likely to continue.

In general, all experts are cautious and recommend investing in the most reliable assets and not risk without need. “Next year will be very difficult, we must think not about how to earn, but about not to lose,” warns macro analyst of Raiffeisenbank Stanislav Murashov. In his opinion, it is worthwhile simply to limit oneself to a balanced portfolio of major currencies - rubles, dollars, euros. Ole Hansen, head of strategy at Saxo Bank, recommends investing in metals such as gold, silver and copper. "Gold is because it is a safe haven, silver is due to its historical cheapness in relation to gold, copper is due to reduced supplies and possible additional incentive measures announced by the Chinese government," he explained.
 
Natalia Milchakova, deputy director of Alpari’s analytical department, also suggests dividing savings between a ruble and dollar deposit in a highly reliable bank and shares of 1-2 issuers of blue chips (shares of the largest companies - Lety.ru comment) good dividends. Sergey Drozdov, an analyst at Finam, believes that, despite the uncertainty prevailing in the Russian stock market, investors should pay attention to the shares of the banking sector. In particular, he recommends the paper of Sberbank, whose business continues to grow and can reach a record level of profit, which, according to preliminary calculations, will rise by 15 percent. Jaroslav Lisovolik, head of Sberbank Investment Research, considers the most promising investments in oil and gas companies and the euro.

Moldovan President Igor Dodon complained to Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev about the difficulties faced by Moldovan manufacturers due to the imposition by Moscow of a ban on the import of Ukrainian goods. The letter of the Moldovan leader published in his Twitter account.
 
Dodon, in particular, noted that the ban “creates barriers for the export of Moldovan products to the Russian market due to the extension of the cargo delivery route and increased traffic flows”.
 
In conclusion, the President of Moldova asked the Russian prime minister to consider "the issue of overcoming the current situation regarding the transportation of Moldovan products to the Russian Federation through the territory of Ukraine."
 
In the commentary to the published letter, Dodon stressed that he had taken personal control of the settlement of the problem and that its solution would be found in the coming days.
 
On December 29, the Russian government banned the import of a number of goods from Ukraine as a response to the actions of the Ukrainian authorities, who had previously banned imports of Russian agro-industrial and chemical products.
 
The list of goods prohibited for import into Russia, in particular, included agricultural and industrial products, including tractors and gas turbines.

The United States declared a trade war to the world. But the Chinese won it
The beginning of the construction of the Tesla plant in Shanghai became known in early January. The company will be the first in its industry, which will be fully owned by foreign investors. Until now, when entering the Chinese market, foreign business was obliged to create joint ventures with local companies and provide them with access to their technologies, which often led to accusations against Beijing of stealing intellectual property. This was one of the reasons for the introduction of duties on Chinese goods in the United States and the start of a trade war between the two countries.
 
The report of the Chinese State Council also states that Lee and Musk "held an in-depth exchange of views on the development of the automotive industry on new sources of energy," and discussed cooperation in the field of innovation, science and technology. The co-owner of Tesla, in turn, spoke about the "impressive growth rates and efficiency in China."
 
In 2018, as a result of the scandal with the repurchase of Tesla shares, Musk lost his position as chairman of the company's board of directors and retained only the post of general director. In his possession remains 19.7 percent of the shares of companies, which makes it the largest owner.

In 2018, the growth of the Russian economy accelerated, despite the sanctions. This is stated in the World Bank report on the prospects for the global economy.
 
The document notes that inflation in the country remained low and stable despite the restrictive measures. “The Russian economy continued to grow steadily amid rising oil prices. <...> Thanks to steady domestic economic activity, growth in the Russian economy accelerated last year to 1.6 percent, ”the report says.
 
According to World Bank forecasts, in 2019 the growth rate of the Russian economy will slow to 1.5 percent. However, in 2020 and 2021, growth will accelerate again and will amount to 1.8 percent.
 
Next year, the World Bank expects a slowdown in the growth of the global economy as a whole. This will occur due to increased tension in trade relations and stricter financing conditions. Also on the pace of economic growth will have a negative impact on the decline in international trade and activity in the manufacturing industry.
 
In October 2018, the head of the Accounts Chamber, Alexei Kudrin, gave his forecast for 2019 and said that economic growth in Russia would be less than one percent. He linked this with Western sanctions, the devaluation of the ruble and the increase in the value-added tax (VAT) to 20 percent.

Lukashenko talks about friendship with Russia. But looking for support in Europe

Last Tuesday, December 25, when most Christians celebrated Christmas, Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Belarusian counterpart Alexander Lukashenko met in Moscow. This meeting was both important and difficult at the same time, and in something, perhaps, fateful. At least Putin’s press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, said before the talks began that the heads of state would have to “check the clock” on many important issues, including further integration. And integration has recently become the most problematic and even painful place for union relations. The parties are ready to integrate, but with conditions. And while the Russian leadership is trying to explain its position, the Belarusian leader flirts with the European Union more and more. How have the relations of Belarus with Russia and the EU changed in this year, in the article “Tapes.ru”.
 
Continue and deepen
The atmosphere before the bilateral meeting was quite tense. Do not continue like Christmas Eve, December 24, Lukashenka said in Minsk that Russia is no longer considered a brotherly nation and the only partner. This opinion arose from the president because of Moscow’s unwillingness to compensate the Belarusian partners for losses from the tax maneuver in the oil sector, which, according to Lukashenko, was firmly promised to him by the Russian side.
 
Such a prelude did not foreshadow easy negotiations, and therefore it is not surprising that the meeting was held behind closed doors and most of its leaders talked one on one. And although both presidents expressed confidence that a mutually beneficial solution was possible, there were no statements on the results, not to mention a joint press conference. Only Finance Minister Anton Siluanov confined himself to general phrases that he managed to agree on a rapprochement of positions and create a working group that will continue and deepen ...

But apparently , the parties have advanced slightly. Already at night, the Belarus-1 television channel, citing the press secretary of the Belarusian president, Natalia Eismont, said that Putin and Lukashenko agreed to hold another meeting before the end of the year to make decisions that “do not tolerate delays.” She added that this is due to the desire of the Russian president to "delve deeper into the essence of the problems." Considering that there is nothing left before the New Year, we can assume that the problems before the two leaders are really difficult and must be addressed today.
 
Knight at the crossroads
In the mass consciousness of Belarus has always remained the most reliable and loyal partner of Russia among all the post-Soviet republics. This is not surprising, as early as December 8, 1999, Lukashenko and Yeltsin signed an agreement on the creation of a Union State of Russia and Belarus, which meant gradual and deep integration. Despite the fact that the implementation of the document was not a shaky one, Lukashenko had a reputation as Russia's main ally, if not all over the world, then certainly in Eastern Europe.
 
However, this never prevented him from looking the other way. During the entire presidency of Alexander Grigorievich, Belarus has declared the multi-vector nature of its foreign policy. In confirmation of this, the “last dictator of Europe” actively cooperated with European partners. The country joined the EU's Eastern Partnership program back in 2009, immediately after its launch, but the western vector of Belarusian politics really intensified after the events on Independence Square in Kiev in the winter of 2013-2014.

Alexander Lukashenko
Where he climbed, there with the EU
What has Lukashenka lifted sanctions in the West
For Lukashenko, it was a real geopolitical fork. He was seriously afraid of the possibility of repeating the Maidan scenario already in Minsk, so he sought to show that he was not Yanukovych, he would cooperate and in no case break the previously reached agreements. In addition, he was clearly frightened not only by the Maidan, but also another scenario — the Crimean one. The crisis of trust between the authorities of Russia and Belarus has reached a peak after all the Ukrainian events, and Lukashenko increasingly began to talk about the need to protect the sovereignty of the country by any means, including the military.
 
Lukashenko’s fifth term (to which he was elected in 2015) passed under completely different slogans and seriously changed the attitude of the Belarusian elites towards their own president. At one time, he came to power in the wake of the rejection of the nationalist tendencies that prevailed in independent Belarus in the first years of its existence. Lukashenko has always been perceived as a president who relies on integration with Russia. In the fifth term, he became the guarantor of sovereignty, and in addition to this, the policy of “soft Belarus” intensified.
 
Taking into account the geopolitical situation in Russia after the Ukrainian events, Lukashenko began to use the multi-vector nature of her foreign policy, primarily to blackmail the Russian side. According to Minsk, Putin will have to make concessions to Belarus in order to maintain "fraternal relations" and "the only ally in Eastern Europe." However, the prospects were much more exciting. The architect of the Western vector of the Belarusian politics was the Minister of Foreign Affairs Vladimir Makei. He has held this post since 2012, and previously for four years headed the administration of the president of Belarus. Starting in 2016, Lukashenko began to build new relations with the EU and the United States. And in the outgoing year, this process continued.

Dictator integrator
While the improvement of relations between Belarus and the European Union is inhibited. The isolation policy was too long, so that some EU sanctions against the Lukashenko regime are still in force. The European Union calls its policy regarding Minsk “critical interaction”. Brussels at the same time builds cooperation with state bodies of Belarus, while insisting on political and economic reforms in the country, and supports the political opposition.
 
Minsk also speaks of the "normalization" of relations with Brussels. For the Belarusian authorities, it is important to lift the last sanctions, expand the agreement on cooperation and investment in the Belarusian economy, remove the discriminatory regime of relations. The latter, for example, slows down the simplification of the visa regime with the EU. Negotiations on this are going on for four years, and the outgoing year was no exception. Each time the parties report on the achievement of certain success, but the signing of a visa-free agreement is “postponed”. This is due, for example, to the fact that Brussels insists on the possibility of a unilateral termination of the agreement in the event of the introduction of repeated sanctions against Belarus. Minsk considers such demands to be discrimination, which, however, does not prevent him from making compliments to European partners.
 
At the end of January 2018, at a meeting with European Commissioner Johannes Khan Lukashenko, he said he was a supporter of a strong European Union. He then called the EU "one of the pillars of security and peace on our planet." It fits badly into the image that the Belarusian president creates for himself, as well as the image that his opponents paint. However, the solution of such a reverent attitude towards European integration from the side of the “last dictator of Europe” lies on the surface.

Recently, statements about the risk of absorption of Belarus by Russia are heard from Lukashenka more and more often. A strong European Union is seen as the guarantor of the country's sovereignty Yes, from time to time European partners have long and tediously demanding reforms, pointing out problems with human rights in Belarus. However, this does not interfere with doing business. And for the sake of investment in the economy and protection from "polite people" you can be patient.

Will Belarus repeat the path of Ukraine, prohibiting the Russian language
In November, the European Investment Bank (EIB) announced plans to invest more than 260 million euros in the Belarusian economy. And on very comfortable conditions, with a rate of one to three percent. Lukashenko commented on this agreement in the following way: “We overcame quite a few barriers, there was a lot of misunderstanding on both sides, especially on the western side. Today, both Europe and the entire Western world have been convinced that it is possible to deal with Belarus, that Belarus is a reliable partner, especially in the sphere of trade, economic and financial relations. ”
 
According to Lukashenka, it is the trade and economic partnership that should be the driver for the rapprochement of his country with the EU. “Talking about democracy, freedom of speech, political prisoners, the abolition of the death penalty - this goes without saying, we do not remove it from the agenda, we boldly and openly talk about it,” the Belarusian leader said then. However, he clarified that the political and economic reforms in the country will begin only when Belarus sees this as financial gain. In the morning, money - in the evening chairs ...
 
Bargaining is appropriate
It would seem that now is the time to think about financial gain and begin political reforms against the background of tense relations with Moscow after the tax maneuver. But the December meeting of the EU-Belarus Coordination Group was held without any progress. The EU has lazily put forward an unchanged list of demands for liberalization, the Belarusians also lazily answered that they will work in this direction, but this is not a quick matter and they are not ready for such changes.
 
In general, it is very similar to the policy of Lukashenko around the Union Treaty with Russia. He envisioned both a single currency and a single parliament, but for almost twenty years now, all of this has remained nothing but talk. As soon as the Russian side recalls this, Lukashenko accuses the Russian Federation of wanting to devour Belarus. At the same time, he calls refusal of financial support (or, for example, a tax maneuver) attempts to disrupt the integration process. It seems that the “integration” for Lukashenko is mainly financial subsidies and customs privileges.
 
In May 2019, the Eastern Partnership program will be ten years old. On this occasion, the EU plans to hold a jubilee forum in which program participants will discuss the success of integration. There is a high probability that this forum will be held in Minsk, however, it is difficult to call it anything but a beautiful and symbolic step. The outgoing year showed that relations between Minsk and Brussels reached a peak. Key sanctions were lifted, not only private, but also public funds from Europe flowed into the Belarusian economy.

However, to continue the integration of Lukashenko, it is necessary to carry out political reforms, and he is not yet ready to change his management system. However, the EU does not offer the Old Man anything for which he would be able to abandon authoritarian power. Full access to the EU markets will not be long, and without the Union State and the EAEU, the Belarusian economy is unlikely to exist. Lukashenko received from the European Union the maximum that Brussels could give him in advance, without large-scale reforms. But now he can use these, albeit minor, preferences as a trump card in negotiations with Moscow, since for the Russian side the relationship with Minsk is largely a matter of prestige.
 
At the same time, for a certain part of the Belarusian elites, rapprochement with the EU is valuable in itself, and not for some financial reasons. Vice-Speaker of the Belarusian Parliament Pirshtuk, for example, stated in October that deepening relations with the EU should become a priority for Belarus and issues that hinder integration should be resolved faster and more efficiently. Will they agree that their dream of cooperation with the EU, to which Belarus has been following a rather winding path for many years, will become just a bargaining chip in bargaining with Moscow? Shows time.

The agreement between members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and the states that have decided to join the cartel agreement does not give the expected effect - oil prices stopped falling, but could not return to significant growth. The dramatic summit of OPEC, which regularly changed the opinions of the parties, and the negotiators came to a consensus only at the very end, did not meet expectations. Experts have already dubbed OPEC as a “zombie organization,” over which Russia has seized control. For Moscow, an alliance with OPEC is important in the context of the transformation of the United States into a leading global energy power - Russia has practically exhausted its opportunities to increase production. New oil world order - in the material "Lente.ru".
 
The next agreement between OPEC and countries outside the cartel is probably no longer able to keep the oil market from a fundamental correction - artificial restrictions simply do not work, the strength of other market participants is too great. Such a conclusion can be reached if you just look at the price chart for a barrel of Brent crude. The new agreement between the countries was concluded on December 7, but its strength was only enough for a week - from December 13, oil prices plummeted and even the assurances of the parties to their agreement to reduce production could not support them.

November 30 - a week before the new contract - the Brent barrel cost $ 59.05, on the day of the deal they reached $ 61.6 per barrel, but from the local peak of December 13 ($ 61.82 per barrel of Brent) they resumed their rapid fall . As a result, the cost of a barrel in the evening of December 21 fluctuated around $ 54 per barrel - at the level of September 2017, dropping in this way more than 10 percent in a week.
 
The annual peak of oil prices was recorded on October 3, when for a barrel of Brent they gave 85.92 dollars. The minimum fell on December 25, the barrel fell to 49.32 dollars. Having pushed off from the bottom, oil began a correction and on the last trading day of 2018 it was trading around $ 52 per barrel - the market froze in anticipation of news.

Russia and OPEC reduce oil production
???? ?? ??? ??? ????? ?????. ??? ??????? ???? ???
The December summit of OPEC was already the fifth in a row, however a similar drawdown in price after the agreement of oil producers was only once - in May 2017. Then, on the day of the deal, Brent's barrel cost $ 51.22, but by June 21, the price had fallen to an annual minimum and fluctuated at $ 44.76 per barrel. At the same time, the fall was not as rapid as it is now - in December 2018, and the main factor behind the sharp fall in prices was the oversupply in the market, as well as the fact that OPEC members and countries outside the cartel agreed to extend the agreement for a year, most experts, but only for nine months. The pressure on oil prices was also exerted by the fact that not all countries complied with the agreement, statistics showed that in June, OPEC + countries mined an average of 25.92 million barrels per day,which is 450 thousand barrels higher than in May, when the summit on reducing production was held.

The current drawdown can be explained by the fact that many countries will not observe new quotas immediately, but gradually. Russia, for example, although it has increased the volumes that it undertakes to reduce production, will begin to implement the new agreement only from January, and then gradually increasing the reduction. Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak explained that in the winter it is more difficult for companies to cut production purely technically. All in all, Russia should remove an additional 228 thousand barrels per day from the market, which for Moscow is an absolute record under the agreement.
 
Zombies are ours!
Also a record on OPEC this time was the influence of Russia. At certain stages of negotiations, Russia's position could put the new deal in doubt - for a long time the Russian delegation refused to make concessions and cut production by more than 150 thousand barrels per day, and at some points, on the contrary, helped the deal to take place. For example, Alexander Novak managed to reconcile the eternal political opponents - Iran and Saudi Arabia, who could not agree on the volume of production cuts.
 
Saudi Arabia, as the leader of the cartel, demanded that Iran cut production at least to symbolic volumes, to which Tehran responded with a decisive refusal because of sanctions from the United States. Sources in the cartel insisted that Novak held bilateral talks with representatives of both countries, after which he was able to convince Saudi Arabia of the need to agree with Iran’s position, however, Russia suddenly agreed to increase the volume of reductions at this stage.

Riyadh speaks extremely positively of the Russian participation in the cartel’s work, for example, Adam Seminsky, president of King Abdullah’s Saudi Oil Analytical Center (KAPSARC), claims that without Russia, oil prices could soar up to $ 300 per barrel however, the expert did not explain why it was to grow against the background of many negative factors for the oil market. However, the more popular opinion is that Russia turned OPEC into a de facto “zombie organization” - without the opinion of Moscow, the cartel can no longer make a crucial decision.
 
And there is evidence of this - during the OPEC summit, Alexander Novak specifically flew to St. Petersburg to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin, after which Russia's position on production volumes softened, and Russia's allies (first of all, Iran, Venezuela and Libya) received concessions . However, much more convincing evidence of this is the reduction data.

Russian gas runs the risk of depreciating. It is beneficial to Ukraine
For example, in comparison with the production level of 2016, some parties to the agreement not only did not reduce production, but, conversely, only increased it. According to estimates from Bloomberg, Kazakhstan has increased production by 15 percent during its participation in the agreement. The leaders of the 2016 cuts from production levels were either countries outside OPEC such as Mexico and Malaysia, or the smallest OPEC members in terms of production volumes - Gabon, Angola, Equatorial Guinea. Compared to the 2016 production level, they reduced production by more than 10 percent, while Russia reduced production by just 0.1 percent. This alignment became possible due to the fact that Saudi Arabia, Russia, the United Arab Emirates and Iraq sharply increased production in the period from May to October 2018 - in total, they threw 1.6 million barrels per day into the market.For comparison, the entire OPEC + agreement of December 7 implied a reduction of production by 1.2 million barrels per day, and this if all countries strictly comply with it, which has not happened yet.
 
Trump effect
The President of the United States regularly advocates for affordable oil prices. In his opinion, this is beneficial to the American economy and the world, however, high oil prices will be pleasing to the United States, which have already become the largest oil producer in the world and, according to the forecasts of OPEC itself, will retain this status for at least the next 17 years. All talk about the profitability of shale production in the United States is gradually fading into the background - the cost of production for shalers has plummeted over the past couple of years and, according to the latest data, is at $ 45 per barrel, moreover, in 2019 this figure can fall to 30 dollars per barrel.

According to forecasts of the international consulting company IHS Markit, by the end of 2020, the United States can bypass Russia in yet another indicator - export volumes. According to the estimates of IHS Markit analysts, by September 2020, the United States can catch up with Russia, reaching a figure of five million barrels per day, but if Russia stays at this level, the United States can surpass these indicators by the end of 2020. Moreover, the export of liquid hydrocarbons from the United States, including oil, oil products and gas condensate, by the end of 2019 may exceed 10 million barrels per day, which will deprive Saudi Arabia of the status of the largest oil exporter in the world. Riyadh currently exports about nine million barrels per day. The top three in the face of Saudi Arabia, the United States and Russia, according to the data of the International Energy Agency (IEA),accounting for about 40 percent of world production.
 
Russia, on the other hand, has almost exhausted its ability to quickly increase oil production - in the coming years, only oil production at hard-to-recover fields with high production costs remained. Energy Minister Alexander Novak notes that without tax breaks, these fields simply will not be put into operation, which means that by 2021-2022, production in Russia will decline.
 
The United States, on the contrary, has a serious margin of safety - more than a hundred drilled wells, which were frozen due to falling oil prices and the high cost of shale projects. Now, when production costs have fallen, US companies can return to these wells. Moreover, the Trump administration has developed a new plan for the return of "energy dominance" to the United States.

As part of this plan, it is planned to allow the extraction of oil and gas in natural reserves, in which the extraction of mineral resources was banned by the previous President Barack Obama. Environmentalists are already sounding the alarm that this may lead to the disappearance of several rare animals, but Trump does not care about such issues. “This decision tells us the following: flora and fauna are unimportant. Rare animals are unimportant. Oil and gas are what really matter, ”says Bobby McKinini, a member of the Council for the Protection of Natural Resources.
 
Sticks in wheels
One of the main fundamental reasons for the decline in oil prices is the slowdown in the Chinese and Indian economies. Investors slowdown in the Chinese economy plunges into panic and shock, as this indicates a sharp decline in world consumption of virtually all groups of goods, including oil and gas. According to the latest World Bank projections, China’s GDP growth rate in 2019 will fall to 6.2 percent of GDP from the current rate of 6.5 percent of GDP per year, which is China’s weakest indicator in the last 28 years. Similar forecasts regarding the Chinese economy are given by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

One of the factors slowing is the trade standoff with the United States. The economic war between the two superpowers had a negative impact on the stock markets of both countries, however, if the American market is out of competition and still holds the leading position, then the Chinese, by the end of 2018, risk dropping to third place in terms of the stock market, giving way to Japan. In just one year, the capitalization of Chinese companies has collapsed by 2.4 trillion dollars, which has become a record value since 2002.

New turn
Chinese authorities have decided to accelerate the economy by tightening the screws. It turned out not very
Viktor Shum, Vice-President of IHS Markit, said that he sees no prospects for strengthening oil prices in the near future. “The question of demand is becoming more and more obvious to people in the oil industry. We are already seeing declining car sales in China. The consumption of diesel fuel in India did not justify forecasts, and in November, it began to decline. These are alarming signals. At the same time, oil reserves in the United States continue to grow, ”said Victor Shum.
 
According to his forecasts, oil has no prospects for recovery, moreover, prices may drop to the level of $ 40 per barrel in the second quarter of 2019 already. But American hedge funds on the contrary believe in the oil rebound is much more active. They have increased long positions on the growth of the benchmark Brent. Analysts explain their behavior by faith in the OPEC + agreement.
 
On its wave
Russia is not afraid of a new collapse - in any case, this is spoken publicly by the press secretary of the Russian president, Dmitry Peskov. According to him, there are no reasons for panic, and the OPEC + agreement in the long term will lead to the stabilization of the market and will have the desired effect, therefore there is no reason for abrupt movements and any emergency meetings. Igor Sechin, head of the Rosneft state-owned company, is in many respects at one with him. In his opinion, the current drawdown of world oil prices is largely due to the tight monetary policy of the US Federal Reserve System (FED), which continues to raise the key rate, thus increasing the value of the dollar.
 
“The main factor in this case was the Fed rate increase, which led to the leaching of financial speculators from the market. We are ready for any situations, ”Sechin said, assuring that no one was afraid of this fall. According to him, the agreement with OPEC is a much more comprehensive solution that will stabilize oil prices in the near future.

Only the head of the Bank of Russia Elvira Nabiullina speaks about the risks for the Russian economy from falling oil prices. Explaining the decision to raise the key rate to 7.75 percent per annum, the head of the regulator recognized the danger of oil oversupply in the market. The Central Bank also associates a similar scenario with a slowdown in the growth of the world's largest economies, which will directly hit the demand for oil and lead to an excess of oil on the market. All these factors forced the regulator to sharply adjust the forecast for the price of oil - from $ 63 per barrel to $ 55.
 
Stability without growth
The Russian economy without any problems can withstand the fall in world oil prices to $ 40 per barrel - this is the figure laid down in the budget for the next three years. All budget revenues from oil at a price exceeding this level go to the formation of a “airbag” to the National Welfare Fund (NWF). Russia can even quite calmly endure a stronger decline, but for this to happen, the government will have to print out reserves in order to reduce the budget.

We can not repeat
One US state is superior to the Russian economy. To greatness very far
But the key task that the authorities are now facing is Russia's access to sustainable economic growth rates at the level of the world average. At the end of 2017, the average global growth rate of the economy was estimated at 3.7 percent of GDP per year. The head of the Accounting Chamber, Alexei Kudrin, recently recalled that the average annual growth rate of the Russian economy over the past 10 years was only one percent. The former finance minister insists that it’s high time for Russia to look for new growth drivers, rather than relying solely on rising oil prices.
 
According to analysts of the American investment bank Bank of America Merrill Lynch, even a weak ruble at the level of 65 rubles per dollar and a rise in oil prices to the level of $ 100 per barrel will not help Russia to reach the world average growth rate. In the event of a similar outcome, GDP growth will be only two percent per year. The country is in dire need of new growth drivers.

Russian sanctions will bring Ukraine billions in losses. This assumption was made by Ukrainian political scientist Mikhail Pogrebinsky in his Facebook.
 
According to him, in 2019, Ukrainian exports to Russia will generally fall by about 20 percent, unless new restrictive measures are introduced. In total, the loss will amount to one billion dollars, wrote Pogrebinsky.
 
He noted that as a result, “the negative balance of Ukraine’s foreign trade activity will grow sharply, which is already growing very quickly and dangerously for the country's economy.” In addition, many Ukrainian products will not find new sales. Because of this, dozens of enterprises may be ruined, and thousands of Ukrainians will be left without work.
 
The political scientist also noted that anti-Ukrainian sanctions would weaken the country's machine-building industry, as a number of restrictions apply to the output of engineering products. This, in turn, will make the Ukrainian economy even more raw. “Besides Russia, nobody needs our generators,” he wrote.
 
Pogrebinsky concluded that the economy of Ukraine is in poor condition, and such strikes as Russian sanctions are extremely painful for it.

Last Tuesday, December 25, when most Christians celebrated Christmas, Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Belarusian counterpart Alexander Lukashenko met in Moscow. This meeting was both important and difficult at the same time, and in something, perhaps, fateful. At least Putin’s press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, said before the talks began that the heads of state would have to “check the clock” on many important issues, including further integration. And integration has recently become the most problematic and even painful place for union relations. The parties are ready to integrate, but with conditions. And while the Russian leadership is trying to explain its position, the Belarusian leader flirts with the European Union more and more. How have the relations of Belarus with Russia and the EU changed in this year, in the article “Tapes.ru”.
 
Continue and deepen
The atmosphere before the bilateral meeting was quite tense. Do not continue like Christmas Eve, December 24, Lukashenka said in Minsk that Russia is no longer considered a brotherly nation and the only partner. This opinion arose from the president because of Moscow’s unwillingness to compensate the Belarusian partners for losses from the tax maneuver in the oil sector, which, according to Lukashenko, was firmly promised to him by the Russian side.
 
Such a prelude did not foreshadow easy negotiations, and therefore it is not surprising that the meeting was held behind closed doors and most of its leaders talked one on one. And although both presidents expressed confidence that a mutually beneficial solution was possible, there were no statements on the results, not to mention a joint press conference. Only Finance Minister Anton Siluanov confined himself to general phrases that he managed to agree on a rapprochement of positions and create a working group that will continue and deepen ...

But apparently , the parties have advanced slightly. Already at night, the Belarus-1 television channel, citing the press secretary of the Belarusian president, Natalia Eismont, said that Putin and Lukashenko agreed to hold another meeting before the end of the year to make decisions that “do not tolerate delays.” She added that this is due to the desire of the Russian president to "delve deeper into the essence of the problems." Considering that there is nothing left before the New Year, we can assume that the problems before the two leaders are really difficult and must be addressed today.
 
Knight at the crossroads
In the mass consciousness of Belarus has always remained the most reliable and loyal partner of Russia among all the post-Soviet republics. This is not surprising, as early as December 8, 1999, Lukashenko and Yeltsin signed an agreement on the creation of a Union State of Russia and Belarus, which meant gradual and deep integration. Despite the fact that the implementation of the document was not a shaky one, Lukashenko had a reputation as Russia's main ally, if not all over the world, then certainly in Eastern Europe.
 
However, this never prevented him from looking the other way. During the entire presidency of Alexander Grigorievich, Belarus has declared the multi-vector nature of its foreign policy. In confirmation of this, the “last dictator of Europe” actively cooperated with European partners. The country joined the EU's Eastern Partnership program back in 2009, immediately after its launch, but the western vector of Belarusian politics really intensified after the events on Independence Square in Kiev in the winter of 2013-2014.

Alexander Lukashenko
Where he climbed, there with the EU
What has Lukashenka lifted sanctions in the West
For Lukashenko, it was a real geopolitical fork. He was seriously afraid of the possibility of repeating the Maidan scenario already in Minsk, so he sought to show that he was not Yanukovych, he would cooperate and in no case break the previously reached agreements. In addition, he was clearly frightened not only by the Maidan, but also another scenario — the Crimean one. The crisis of trust between the authorities of Russia and Belarus has reached a peak after all the Ukrainian events, and Lukashenko increasingly began to talk about the need to protect the sovereignty of the country by any means, including the military.
 
Lukashenko’s fifth term (to which he was elected in 2015) passed under completely different slogans and seriously changed the attitude of the Belarusian elites towards their own president. At one time, he came to power in the wake of the rejection of the nationalist tendencies that prevailed in independent Belarus in the first years of its existence. Lukashenko has always been perceived as a president who relies on integration with Russia. In the fifth term, he became the guarantor of sovereignty, and in addition to this, the policy of “soft Belarus” intensified.
 
Taking into account the geopolitical situation in Russia after the Ukrainian events, Lukashenko began to use the multi-vector nature of her foreign policy, primarily to blackmail the Russian side. According to Minsk, Putin will have to make concessions to Belarus in order to maintain "fraternal relations" and "the only ally in Eastern Europe." However, the prospects were much more exciting. The architect of the Western vector of the Belarusian politics was the Minister of Foreign Affairs Vladimir Makei. He has held this post since 2012, and previously for four years headed the administration of the president of Belarus. Starting in 2016, Lukashenko began to build new relations with the EU and the United States. And in the outgoing year, this process continued.

Dictator integrator
While the improvement of relations between Belarus and the European Union is inhibited. The isolation policy was too long, so that some EU sanctions against the Lukashenko regime are still in force. The European Union calls its policy regarding Minsk “critical interaction”. Brussels at the same time builds cooperation with state bodies of Belarus, while insisting on political and economic reforms in the country, and supports the political opposition.
 
Minsk also speaks of the "normalization" of relations with Brussels. For the Belarusian authorities, it is important to lift the last sanctions, expand the agreement on cooperation and investment in the Belarusian economy, remove the discriminatory regime of relations. The latter, for example, slows down the simplification of the visa regime with the EU. Negotiations on this are going on for four years, and the outgoing year was no exception. Each time the parties report on the achievement of certain success, but the signing of a visa-free agreement is “postponed”. This is due, for example, to the fact that Brussels insists on the possibility of a unilateral termination of the agreement in the event of the introduction of repeated sanctions against Belarus. Minsk considers such demands to be discrimination, which, however, does not prevent him from making compliments to European partners.
 
At the end of January 2018, at a meeting with European Commissioner Johannes Khan Lukashenko, he said he was a supporter of a strong European Union. He then called the EU "one of the pillars of security and peace on our planet." It fits badly into the image that the Belarusian president creates for himself, as well as the image that his opponents paint. However, the solution of such a reverent attitude towards European integration from the side of the “last dictator of Europe” lies on the surface.

Recently, statements about the risk of absorption of Belarus by Russia are heard from Lukashenka more and more often. A strong European Union is seen as the guarantor of the country's sovereignty Yes, from time to time European partners have long and tediously demanding reforms, pointing out problems with human rights in Belarus. However, this does not interfere with doing business. And for the sake of investment in the economy and protection from "polite people" you can be patient.

According to Lukashenka, it is the trade and economic partnership that should be the driver for the rapprochement of his country with the EU. “Talking about democracy, freedom of speech, political prisoners, the abolition of the death penalty - this goes without saying, we do not remove it from the agenda, we boldly and openly talk about it,” the Belarusian leader said then. However, he clarified that the political and economic reforms in the country will begin only when Belarus sees this as financial gain. In the morning, money - in the evening chairs ...
 
Bargaining is appropriate
It would seem that now is the time to think about financial gain and begin political reforms against the background of tense relations with Moscow after the tax maneuver. But the December meeting of the EU-Belarus Coordination Group was held without any progress. The EU has lazily put forward an unchanged list of demands for liberalization, the Belarusians also lazily answered that they will work in this direction, but this is not a quick matter and they are not ready for such changes.
 
In general, it is very similar to the policy of Lukashenko around the Union Treaty with Russia. He envisioned both a single currency and a single parliament, but for almost twenty years now, all of this has remained nothing but talk. As soon as the Russian side recalls this, Lukashenko accuses the Russian Federation of wanting to devour Belarus. At the same time, he calls refusal of financial support (or, for example, a tax maneuver) attempts to disrupt the integration process. It seems that the “integration” for Lukashenko is mainly financial subsidies and customs privileges.
 
In May 2019, the Eastern Partnership program will be ten years old. On this occasion, the EU plans to hold a jubilee forum in which program participants will discuss the success of integration. There is a high probability that this forum will be held in Minsk, however, it is difficult to call it anything but a beautiful and symbolic step. The outgoing year showed that relations between Minsk and Brussels reached a peak. Key sanctions were lifted, not only private, but also public funds from Europe flowed into the Belarusian economy.

However, to continue the integration of Lukashenko, it is necessary to carry out political reforms, and he is not yet ready to change his management system. However, the EU does not offer the Old Man anything for which he would be able to abandon authoritarian power. Full access to the EU markets will not be long, and without the Union State and the EAEU, the Belarusian economy is unlikely to exist. Lukashenko received from the European Union the maximum that Brussels could give him in advance, without large-scale reforms. But now he can use these, albeit minor, preferences as a trump card in negotiations with Moscow, since for the Russian side the relationship with Minsk is largely a matter of prestige.
 
At the same time, for a certain part of the Belarusian elites, rapprochement with the EU is valuable in itself, and not for some financial reasons. Vice-Speaker of the Belarusian Parliament Pirshtuk, for example, stated in October that deepening relations with the EU should become a priority for Belarus and issues that hinder integration should be resolved faster and more efficiently. Will they agree that their dream of cooperation with the EU, to which Belarus has been following a rather winding path for many years, will become just a bargaining chip in bargaining with Moscow? Shows time.

Even Vietnamese who do not know the language sing Russian songs
 
FOR THOSE WHO HAVE GROWN IN THE USSR VIETNAM, UNDERLY, FRIENDLY COUNTRY. THE SAME ATTITUDE FROM ITS CITIZENS TO US SEEMS NATURAL. BUT TIMES GO. GROWN NEW GENERATIONS, CHANGED LOCATION OF FORCES IN THE WORLD. WHAT ARE OUR RELATIONS TODAY?
 
The Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary Ambassador of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam to the Russian Federation NGO HOOK MAN told the prospects for the development of cooperation between our countries to Igor CHERNYAKU, Chief Editor of AiF
 
WHAT EXCEPT THE BEACH?
 
- Dear Mr. Ambassador, 4 years ago Vietnam was almost a champion for good relations with Russia - 73% of its residents called our country a friend. Has this attitude survived after a whole series of accusations of Russia from the West - from the Crimean spring to Salisbury?
 
- I think if we conduct a survey now, then, like 4 years ago, Vietnam will be the leader. And in the future between the citizens of our countries the kindest feelings will remain, and we will forever remain good and sincere friends.
 
It has historical roots, because the Vietnamese people received tremendous help from the peoples of the USSR, including from the Russian people, during the long heroic struggle for independence, and then during the restoration of the country. We feel support now as we implement a comprehensive update policy - Doy Moi.
 
Moreover, many generations of Vietnamese were educated at leading Russian universities and have good memories of Russia, its people and culture. Even those who have never been to your country sympathize with her and her people, not knowing the language, nevertheless they sing Russian songs. There is much in common between us , and the deep attachment of the Vietnamese people to the Russian is time tested.
 
- In recent years, the flow of tourists from Russia to Vietnam has steadily increased, while the quality of recreation is increasing. But they go mainly to two points - Nha Trang and Phu Quoc. Will there be new offers and in general - what will Vietnam try to surprise tourists in 2019?
 
- The flow of Russian tourists is indeed growing rapidly - over the past 3 years, it has increased much faster than from the USA and Taiwan. In 2017, 500 thousand Russian tourists rested here, by the end of this year a record is expected - 574 thousand. The popularity of Vietnam as a place of rest is explained not only by the beautiful nature, beautiful beaches, ancient temple complexes, high quality of service and low prices, but also visa-free regime of stay of citizens of the Russian Federation to 15, and on the island of Phu Quoc - up to 30 days. In addition, it is safe to relax with us.
 
Every year, Vietnam travel agencies take part in the International Tourism Fair MITT in Moscow, where they present new offers. But Russian tourists are more attracted to beach holidays - this explains the choice of Nha Trang and Fukuoka. However, believe me, in Vietnam there are still many beautiful places that are worth seeing - Da Nang, Hoi An, Qui Nhon. And we have something to surprise - we offer participation in fairs, festivals and national holidays, visiting craftsmen’s villages. You can live with representatives of the peoples of Vietnam, try traditional cuisine and imbued with traditions. Spiritual tourism is visiting temples, sacred places. A wellness vacation is also offered using the capabilities of the famous Oriental medicine.
 
In the coming 2019, it will be 25 years since the signing of the Treaty on the Fundamentals of Friendly Relations between the Russian Federation and the SRV, and this will be the “Cross Year of Russia and Vietnam” I am sure that it will become special in relations between the two countries and cooperation in the field of tourism will receive a new impetus.
 
METRO IN HOSHIMIN
 
- Your country has become the world's largest coffee producer, but we don’t see it in Russian Vietnamese coffee shops. Infrequently on sale and familiar to the older generation of slippers, flip-flops and thermoses. Nevertheless, the trade turnover between our countries last year set a record. What does Vietnam supply to Russia today and what does it get from us?
 
- After more than 30 years of implementation of the policy of renewal and active integration into the world economy, Vietnam has become a major exporter of many products - such as agricultural products (coffee, rice, seafood, cashews, black pepper, etc.) and light industry goods, and high-tech goods - electronics, computers, phones.
 
In recent years, especially after the Agreement on Free Trade Zone between Vietnam and the EEU entered into force in 2016, Russian-Vietnamese trade and economic cooperation has been booming. Bilateral trade in 2015 is growing at a rate of 30% per year. Vietnam is Russia's largest trading partner in Southeast Asia.
 
Vietnam's exports to Russia are diverse: from seafood, coffee, tea, tropical fruits and vegetables to clothing, shoes, mobile phones, computers, electrical goods. And our country imports wheat, seafood, steel, gasoline, fertilizers, chemical products, machinery and parts from Russia from Russia.
 
- During Soviet times, Vietnam had many large-scale construction projects with the participation of our country. Less now. Are you considering the possibility of returning to the NPP project and what other infrastructure projects may emerge with the help of Russia?
 
“Thanks to the support of the USSR, large infrastructure facilities have emerged that still make a significant contribution to the social and economic development of Vietnam: 5 hydroelectric power stations and thermal power plants, an oil pipeline system, the Thang Long Bridge. In addition, projects have been implemented for the development of oil and gas fields.
 
In order to increase electricity production and diversify its supply, Vietnam made a decision to build a nuclear power plant in Ninh Thuan province in cooperation with Russia. However, due to the fact that economic conditions have not yet allowed, we were forced to suspend the project. In the future, when conditions allow, Russia will be a priority partner in this construction.
 
Now in Vietnam 120 Russian investment projects are being implemented, investments in which are estimated at $ 1 billion. Vietnam has 20 investment projects worth $ 3 billion in Russia. Of these, I would mention the THcorporation’s project to create a high-tech dairy farming and milk processing the multifunctional center Hanoi-Moscow, already familiar to the residents of the Russian capital.
 
At the end of October, at a meeting of the Russian-Vietnamese Intergovernmental Commission on Trade, Economic, and Scientific and Technical Cooperation, they discussed cooperation in major infrastructure projects, such as the construction of a metro and railway line in Ho Chi Minh City.
 
MARKET WITH SOCIALIST ORIENTATION
 
- Vietnam, unlike Russia, did not abandon socialism, the Communist Party remains the leading political force in the country. Nevertheless, in recent years you have developed both private business and capitalist relations. How do they get along together?
 
- In Vietnam, socialism and market economy, the leading role of the Communist Party and the dynamic development of private business are harmoniously combined. World public opinion assesses our model as successful, because it gives us the opportunity to grow with a growth rate of 6% annually.
 
Party leadership is the leading factor in organizing all the victories of the revolutionary cause of Vietnam. It was the party that initiated and led the reform of a comprehensive renewal, moving from a centrally planned economy to a socialist-oriented market. That is, the economy operates according to market mechanisms, but is under government regulation. Key sectors are under the jurisdiction of the state, but at the same time the private sector is one of the important engines.
 
We built an internationally integrated economy and at the same time, we retained the main guideline: the development of the private sector is aimed at the welfare of the people. Therefore, our model has received support from the people, who is its creator.

Vladimir Putin: “If officials cannot implement national projects, let them make room for optimists!”
 
DECEMBER 20 WAS HELD THE 14TH LARGE PRESS CONFERENCE OF VLADIMIR PUTIN. FOR THREE HALF-HOURS, HE RESPONDED TO 66 ISSUES OF JOURNALISTS, AND ONLY ON THE MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT, PRESENTED ALMOST 1700 MEDIA REPRESENTATIVES FROM DIFFERENT REGIONS OF RUSSIA AND MANY COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD.

ECONOMY
 
HOW SANCTIONS Affect RUSSIA?
 
The economy has adapted to external constraints. After the 2008-2009 crisis, our GDP fell by 7.8%, there were no sanctions. And after the introduction of sanctions in 2014, the decline was 2.5%. The Ministry of Finance of the United States believes that this fall is due to one third of the sanctions, and two thirds - with a fall in oil prices. I think this third is not there either.
 
From sanctions there are pluses. They forced us to turn on brains in some areas. Yes, this led to an increase in prices in the food market, but then everything stabilized.
 
Is there sufficient production support ? Not enough . That is why we have outlined a number of programs. And in general, until 2024, it will amount to 1 trillion 376 billion rubles. This also applies to light industry and aviation, and this also applies to the military-industrial complex and other industries.
 
We have a growing volume of gas sales to the external market. This year will be 200 billion cubic meters. This is a historical maximum.
 
In order for the ruble to strengthen as a regional reserve currency, you need to solve several problems. First, you need to reduce volatility. The course must be stable, and in general we are given this. He even came off a little from the fluctuations in oil prices. Secondly, it is necessary to increase the number of calculations in rubles.
 
Advertising of exchange rates is being removed, and citizens were wondering if this is not related to the ban on the dollar circulation. I want to reassure everyone, this is due only to one thing - the fight against illegal money exchange offices. It’s just putting money in order.
 
STATISTICS
 
WHY DO NUMBERS DIFFER FROM LIFE?
 
For 10 months of this year, GDP grew by 1.7%. The forecast of the Ministry of Economic Development for the year is 1.8%. Industrial production in January-October increased by 2.9%, for the year is projected 3%.
 
Last year, unemployment beat the historical minimum - it was 5.2%, this year it will be even lower - 4.8%.
 
The real level of wages is growing. For the first 10 months of this year, this is 7.4%, and for the year is expected to be about 7%.
 
We have the average size of the old-age insurance pension in 2017 amounted to 13 677 rubles. At the end of this year there will be 14 163. And the life expectancy has slightly increased: in 2017 it was 72.7 years, in 2018 there will be 72.9.
 
It is necessary to better explain to people where these numbers come from and what they mean. Because when simply bare numbers are presented and they say that “life has become better, life has become more fun,” and people see a real increase in price tags in stores, this causes confusion and generates mistrust of these statistics. She, by the way, is imperfect. But it's not so much about its quality, the point is to explain to people that these are average numbers.
 
Why statistics, ministerial reports often do not coincide with what people see with their own eyes, and how can this be corrected? Opinion of Alexei Skopin, a professor at Moscow University for the Humanities:
 
"It is necessary that the addressee, to whom the officials address with their figures and reports, should change. This should not be the supervisor who assesses their work, but ordinary people. Only then will the desire and ability to explain the complex processes that occur in the economy and social sphere.
 
Distorts the real situation and the approach to information processing. In Russia, a huge gap between 1% of the population, which owns 43% of wealth, and the remaining 99%. But statistics evens out the situation, summing up the rich and the poor. As a result, when we talk about income, it turns out that the majority of the population belongs to the middle class, although in reality it is only 7-8%. And when the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, then from the point of view of average statistics nothing changes. Therefore, you need to abandon the generalized figures. We need to separately assess changes in people's incomes in different social groups and in different regions of the country, which also differ greatly in terms of opportunities and earnings. "
 
SOCIETY
 
CAN YOU RETURN SOCIALISM?
 
The deep state of society is such that the restoration of socialism is impossible. Possible elements of socialization of the economy, social sphere. Equitable distribution of resources, fair treatment of people who live below the poverty line, building state policies so as to minimize the number of people who live below the poverty line.
 
In the early 2000s and in the middle I said that I was categorically against raising the retirement age. Then impossible
 
was doing it. If I had not been convinced that it was inevitable, I would never have allowed it.
 
There are rules that must be observed everywhere. How does Internet behavior differ from what is beyond the boundaries of the Internet? This is also a society, especially the Internet has penetrated into all spheres of our life.
 
Regarding the detention of rappers - this is to nothing, it leads to the opposite of the expected result.
 
The situation in prisons should be primarily under the control of the Prosecutor General’s Office. All offenses and crimes there must be punished. This is what happens when, thanks to the media, such facts surface.
 
Now we produce 80% of essential medicines. And more and more, these are not just generics that we take from abroad, but the original substances manufactured in Russia.
 
AiF asked the experts what foreign drugs have not yet been replaced by domestic counterparts. “The bulk of modern anti-inflammatory drugs of biological origin (in the end have“ mab ”- rituximab, infliximab, and others) are purchased abroad,” said Professor Pavel Vorobiov , chairman of the Moscow Urban Scientific Society of Therapists. foreign. And they are used to prevent stroke in atrial fibrillation (a type of cardiac arrhythmia). "
 
Nevertheless, in recent years there have indeed been breakthroughs in pharmacology. “One of the latest developments of the Institute of Molecular Medicine is a drug for the treatment of celiac disease and gluten intolerance,” said Rector of the First Moscow State Medical University named after Sechenov Pyotr Glybochko. The so-called molecular cocktails for personalized treatment of cancer patients are the future of these drugs. Another study, jointly with the University of Vienna, is being conducted on a cat allergy vaccine. go and vaccine against other types of allergies. "
 
ECOLOGY
 
WHAT WILL WE DO WITH POWDERS?
 
For decades, we just dumped trash in the pits. Nobody was engaged in processing. We have a minimum of 70 million tons of garbage produced annually, and nowhere to go. And with the development of industry, the amount of garbage only increases.
 
It is necessary to eliminate illegal dumps, to build the processing industry. We must use our international experience in its best options.
 
It is necessary that the plants were high quality and efficient, so as not to save on filters. We have to build 200 processing plants by 2024.
 
The opinion of the chairman of the State Duma Committee on Ecology and Environmental Protection, Vladimir Burmatov:
 
- The construction of 200 plants is a feasible task. But regions must be connected to it. It is necessary to start with separate collection of garbage - no recycling will work without separate collection. Now in the Russian Federation there are already more than 80 waste recycling plants, but they are loaded only by 30-40% - there are no raw materials. Governors are lazy to engage in separate garbage collection and are in collusion with those who dump it on landfills. From this approach it is necessary to move away.
 
What could be the new recycling plants? First, recycling is possible, then - disposal of residues in different ways. For example, by burning with the use of modern environmentally friendly technologies. The president cited the example of Japan, where waste incineration plants are located right in the center of cities. The situation is similar in Sweden. This country imports garbage from Germany and the UK. First, it is recycled, and the remains burned. And the energy that was formed as a result of combustion, is returned to the network. Incineration plants are right in the cities, and people are happy about it: no emissions, but the electricity is cheap.
 
UKRAINE
 
HOW WILL YOU BUILD RELATIONS WITH KIEV?
 
The provocation in the Kerch Strait is designed to exacerbate the situation in order to raise the rating of one of the presidential candidates. Did the provocation help Ukraine? Poroshenko's rating seems to have grown. In this sense, he completed his task. As for the Ukrainian military, they were sent, hoping that someone would die. But, thank God, this did not happen.
 
Who imposed the blockade between the Donbas and the rest of Ukraine? Has Russia done this? This was done by the Ukrainian authorities: they imposed a continuous economic blockade of the territory, which they consider theirs. And they shoot at these citizens, which they consider their own. There, almost every day, peaceful people die.
 
The trade turnover between Ukraine and Russia, despite the best efforts of today's Kiev authorities, is growing. Is this not strange? No, not strange, because it is a natural connection.
 
What is happening now in Orthodoxy (in Ukraine. - Ed.) Is incomprehensible to the mind. State intervention in the life of the church - this has not happened since the Soviet Union. Created the splitting church of the Istanbul parish. The UOC-MP was completely independent, they did everything on their own, including electing hierarchs. The connection was only spiritual, the patriarch was recalled in the sermons (Moscow and All Russia. - Ed.) ... This is done on the eve of the election campaign and for further break between the Russian and Ukrainian peoples. I am afraid that this will begin the redistribution of property, it may acquire a heavy, even bloody character.
 
The main motive of Bartholomew (Patriarch of Constantinople), except, of course, prompts from Washington, is to subjugate the territory, and then also earn from it.
 
Opinion of the First Deputy Chairman of the State Duma Committee on CIS Affairs Konstantin Zatulin:
 
- First of all, the president once again made it clear: he understands what a difficult situation is in Donetsk and Lugansk, and confirms Russia's readiness to continue helping these territories. In addition, Putin noted the ambiguity of the position of Western countries. On the one hand, they consider Crimea to be the territory of Ukraine, and on the other, they impose sanctions on the peninsula, do everything to make the life of local residents unbearable. That is, according to the logic of Western politicians, they impose sanctions against Ukrainian citizens, and Kiev strongly approves of this.
 
No less strange is the position of the West on the incident in the Kerch Strait. Russia continues to attribute aggressive intentions in this region, accused of wanting to take control of the Sea of ??Azov. Forgetting that this is not Moscow, but Kiev first began to delay fishing vessels. This Kiev unilaterally expanded its maritime territory, and the Western countries supported it, although in other cases (for example, in the South China Sea), they strongly oppose it. The dual politics of the Western media, which scream about the poor Ukrainian military detained by our border guards, is also striking, but they don’t write a word about Russian fishermen detained by Ukrainians.
 
It is also important that the president said about Kiev’s attempts to break the cultural community between Russia and Ukraine at any cost. However, in spite of everything, relations between our countries remain. And whoever is in power in Kiev, the closest ties between the two nations can not be broken.
 
DIPLOMACY
 
WHAT DOES RUSSIA GET ON THE WORLD ARENA?
 
The United States withdraws from the treaty on medium and short-range missiles. Of course, we will need to ensure our security. Let then not squeak about the fact that we are achieving some advantages. We do not achieve the benefits, but maintain the balance.
 
700 billion US dollars are spent on defense, and we are 46. We have 146 million citizens in Russia and 600 million in NATO countries, and you think our goal is to rule the world? It is a stamp that is imposed. In order to rally the NATO countries, a general threat is imperative.
 
I hope that in the end we will reach the bottom of our relations with the United States and understand that we need to rise, we need to push off from this bottom.
 
The danger of such a development of events in the world (nuclear war. - Ed.) Is somehow obscured. Meanwhile, if, God forbid, something like this arises, it can lead to the death of all civilization. I presume that humanity has enough sense of self-preservation, so as not to bring it to extremes.
 
We do not understand the level of sovereignty of Japan when making decisions (on the deployment of American bases in the country.
 
Okinawa Governor opposes some decisions related to the strengthening of the base and its expansion. He is against it, but he cannot do anything about it. And the people who live there are against it, but they cannot do anything.
 
Russia almost all of its history lives in one way or another in some restrictions and sanctions ... The introduction of sanctions is associated with the growth of Russia's power, with increased competitiveness. There is a powerful, strong player with whom you need to reckon, but do not want to. More recently, it was thought that there is no such country anymore, but it turns out there is and must be reckoned with.
 
I agree with Trump, we have achieved significant changes in the fight against terrorism and have dealt a significant blow to the IG (organization is banned in the Russian Federation. - Ed.) In Syria. As for the withdrawal of American troops, I do not know what it is. The United States is present in Afghanistan for how many, 17 years? And almost every year they say that they withdraw their troops from there.
 
The main goal of our foreign policy is to provide favorable conditions for the economic and social development of the Russian Federation so that it takes a worthy place in the international arena as an equal among equals.
 
Opinion program director of the Valdai Club Timofey Bordachev:
 
- In the president’s responses to foreign policy questions, I would point out two of the most important points. First, he stated that the Western policy towards Russia is hostile in the long term, and we need to build our work with this in mind. Secondly, Russia is not going to arrange any cold wars and is always ready for dialogue if this dialogue is based on mutual respect. Separately, I would note the president’s response to the question of concluding a peace treaty with Japan. Putin stressed that, until the Japanese side gives guarantees that the US military bases will not appear in the Kuril Islands, in Tokyo they can not count on any agreement with Russia.
 
SAID
 
We must definitely stop the practice of attracting citizens' money associated with the unfair spending of this money. Money is withdrawn, and people get nothing at all, neither money nor housing. We must stop this practice, even if it leads to some reduction in the volume of construction. And those people who are already in a difficult situation, they need help.
 
If officials feel that they cannot implement national projects, then let them make room for optimists.
 
Bureaucracy is eternal! It is impossible to defeat it, but it is impossible to live without it.
 
If there are any people who violate Russian laws, regardless of their national or state identity, we will react to this. But let's not grab any innocent people just to change them for someone.
 
There would be no Skripale, something else would be invented (our external partners. - Ed.). And there is only one goal - to restrain the development of Russia as a possible competitor. I see no other goals.
 
All my cooks are employees of the Federal Security Service. They are military people, in different ranks are. I have no other chefs.
 
Unfortunately, Russophobia is still flourishing in many countries, especially in Eastern Europe. For what? In order to ensure on the basis of previous historical fears its internal political well-being.
 
In any of our territory, we are entitled and will build our military policy as we see fit to ensure security. And Crimea is no exception.
 
It is possible to occupy the fifth place in terms of GDP, but we must enter another league in terms of the quality of the economy.
 
BTW
 
During the press conference, journalists asked the president whether he would marry and, if so, who.
 
“As a decent person, I will have to do it once,” Putin said, having gone from answering the question of who could be his second half.
 
They asked the head of state about health.
 
“You can’t wait,” the president answered cheerfully. “I play sports and try to keep an eye on my health. Today everything is in order.”

This year, Putin talked to journalists for 3 hours and 40 minutes.
 
Attention of the president tried to attract all kinds of posters.

US PREPARES GEORGIA FOR NEW WAR WITH RUSSIA: SECRET BIOLABORATORY, NATO BASE AND PORT FOR NUCLEAR TRAYS

Spetskor "KP" Daria ASLAMOVA saw how on the borders with our country under the leadership of the West creates an aggressive state.
 
PART 2
 
Ending. Start see in the room for December 20 with. and on the site kp . ru .
 
"WHERE DO WE HAVE A DENYE?"
 
The village of Alekseyevka, where the secret American biolaboratory is located, is located two steps from the new international airport, which, frankly, is surprising. Typically, such objects are built in the desert for security reasons.
 
Alekseevka - a former Soviet military town, from which there were Khrushchev. The laboratory itself looks like a modern administrative building, to which the railway line is suitable.
 
In the village there are houses behind high fences, and on each it says “For Sale”. Rain pours in buckets, people hid. Only an elderly woman with a broom cleans garbage before entering. Her name is Tina, she invites me to the courtyard and says that she also wants to sell her house.
 
- Yes, what a fool will buy it? We all got stuck here. There is no escape from this laboratory. Everyone in the village has headaches, weakness in the legs, hypertension. Maybe it should be. We are not doctors.
 
Tina's neighbor, who refused to give her name, says that strange smells come out of the sewer every night.
 
“We have a sewage system with the laboratory,” he explains. - They poured something there. Not one of the residents was taken to work there, so we have no idea what is going on there. Many cancers are among the residents lately.
 
I am not an expert, but ordinary everyday questions torment me. Well, Georgia is now an unfriendly country, with which we do not even have diplomatic relations. But I remember how the ex-Minister of State Security of Georgia, Igor Giorgadze, laughed when I naively noticed that the CSTO countries, our allies, would never allow this to happen.
 
It turned out that in 2016 in Armenia, the US Department of Defense opened as many as three laboratories: in Yerevan, Gyumri and Ijevan. 130 million dollars spent by the Pentagon on "large
 
research base "in Alma-Ata with a multi-level security. In Azerbaijan, the United States fully controlled the network of biological stations and facilities remaining after the Soviet Union. The US spent $ 170 million on updating. , Andijan, Fergana, Urgench, Bukhara. We don’t know how many of them are, only in Ukraine there are 15 biological laboratories and a whole network of secret biological stations.
 
Igor Giorgadze told me about the patents obtained by the Georgian laboratory. There are several of them: a patent for an unmanned aerial vehicle for the distribution of infected insects in the air, a patent for ammunition for viral capsules for the destruction of an adversary with deadly diseases, and an apparatus capable of spraying chemical and biological substances. Are you still not afraid?
 
But it's not so bad. NATO is preparing Georgia as a springboard for a new war with Russia.
 
TOO LATE?
 
There is such a wonderful resort town in Georgia called Anaklia, right on the border with Abkhazia. Sochi is within reach.
 
Remember, because of what the Americans organized a coup in Ukraine? They needed a base right in the Crimea. Did not work out. But in Anaklia, they do everything quietly. Allegedly won a tender for the construction of a commercial port.
 
“Back in the days of Brezhnev, a draft naval base in Anaklia was developed,” says Major General Tristan Tsitelashvili. - But the money was not enough. And then Gorbachev came, and it was all over. There is a great place - a canyon 400 meters deep, where submarines can enter. The Americans have already begun work, and soon there will be THEIR submarines.
 
And not far from Tbilisi, in Vaziani, an old Soviet airfield remained. Now there is a Georgian base. Americans expand it, strengthen and prepare for sharing.
 
In the village of Krtsanisi, near the base, a NATO training center was created, where a whole group of American officers are already working. All Georgian officers MUST go through training in Krtsanasi. Only after that they have the right to become commanders. This is a career issue.
 
- Yes, Georgia, has really signed a declaration that it provides its base for American cargo aircraft. What's wrong with that? We are allies, ”expert Vakhtang Maisaya proudly says. - Moreover, the Americans are preparing nine Georgian motorized infantry battalions.
 
- Against who?
 
- Against the aggressive policy that the Russian government pursues in the region. Russia and Georgia are enemies. We do not have diplomatic relations. There is a cold war, and we are on the side of America. It's simple. We receive defensive weapons from the USA and, in turn, support the Americans in Afghanistan, where 800 of our servicemen are present.
 
- And what are they doing there?
 
- Maintain armed stability.
 
I'm starting to laugh outright.
 
- Yes, stability there is growing every year, given the fact that 80 percent of the country is controlled by the Taliban. And in general, what bad has Georgia done to Afghanistan?
 
- In Georgia comes heroin.
 
“Well, under the Taliban, he did not come to you at all, because they destroyed the poppy crops.” But the intentions are clear - even if it is a carcass, even a stuffed animal, but to be involved in NATO. Now, regarding European integration. This is a mantra that I have heard from Georgian politicians for ten years. What does this mean?
 
- Value questions! Protection from totalitarianism! We were forcibly included in the geopolitical Russian space, and since 1999 we have changed our course from East to West.
 
- Well, about forced inclusion - this is a controversial issue. In 1783 the Treaty of St. George was signed, and the Georgians literally begged Russia to save them from the Persians and Turks. And how many Russian people died to save you from physical destruction. But, of course, the values ??of the Western world are more important to you. So what is your goal now?
 
- We want to become part of the European Union.
 
“But they don't want that.” They announced long ago that they had suspended the expansion. And you will not get into NATO because of the fifth Article of the Charter - a country that has unresolved territorial problems cannot become a member of the alliance.
 
- But the European Union has made for us a visa-free entry.
 
- So what's so good about it?
 
- Our people can work there!
 
- And this is good?! Under the USSR, Georgia’s population was 5.5 million. Now officially 3.7 million. Of these, according to various sources, at least 40 percent work abroad. That is, you have lost at least half of your population! And rejoice in the fact that now the Georgians can go to the EU.
 
- I think your numbers are wrong. And we are talking about values.
 
- Of course! Values ??remain, the population will run away.
 
“I think we will never understand each other in this matter,” expert Vakhtang Maisay says proudly.
 
"WE LIVE FOR YOUR ACCOUNT AND YOU ARE THE GADIM"
 
“Tell me, are your officials idiots?” - political scientist Gulbaat Rtskhiladze asks me.
 
I am politically correct and silent. Do not give up their own.
 
- And I'll tell you straight: idiots. Georgia lives at your expense. In the literal sense. You have opened the border for our products. All our wine, cheeses, honey, and fruit poured in there. All that we produce is devouring the bottomless Russian market.
 
- You still appreciate yourself. In my area Georgian wine costs 200 rubles more than a simple French Bordeaux.
 
- Not at all surprised. Russian sentimental. And your tsekhoviki in Vladikavkaz produce fake hvanchkara. Not bad earn. Yes, and we sin to complain. Last year, over a million Russian tourists came to Georgia. It is now expensive for us to travel to Batumi. Everything has risen in price. Hotels, taxis, restaurants. Everyone wants to grab their own. This is a living economy! Remittances come in currencies from Russia - sometimes up to half of the total flow. We use it, we survive at your expense, and you are fooled.
 
You can cover this shop in one moment and close the border. And set your own conditions: the termination of the construction of the American port, the closure of the NATO base and the three secret American biological laboratories, because it threatens the security of the country. And Georgia will howl! She has already got used to living at the expense of Russia.
 
Understand, we have no anti-Russian sentiments in society. According to polls, 40 percent are for rapprochement with Russia, and 80 percent are for dialogue. We have real values ??that bind us: history, culture, religion, economy.
 
We have an anti-Russian elite. Installation in the media and in schools: remember only the bad in relations with the Russians, as, they say, they oppressed us, killed us, but we cannot talk about good things. And this is where our young people are brought up!
 
I understand: Russia is not up to Georgia now. Your Donbass is on fire, there is tension in the Kerch Strait. You have Syria and sanctions. And local anti-Russian forces feel it and become impudent. Russia now has no policy towards Georgia. Russia is so happy that she got rid of Saakashvili, that she decided: let's leave everything as it is.
 
***
 
QUESTION - RIB
 
Where are our allies?
 
Together with well-known journalist Valery Kvaratskhelia, I watch a Georgian talk show with Russian subtitles, where they once again discuss who attacked whom in August 2008. The tone is extremely aggressive. Those who try to refer to the facts are immediately silenced.
 
- Valera, this is nonsense! There is a video where Saakashvili brags about how they took Tskhinval. There is the conclusion of the European Commission that Georgia started the war and killed the Russian peacekeepers.
 
- Yes, people are driven into the heads of the false version of events. But this is your fault. You are not cultivating a single pro-Russian candidate for power. There is not a single non-governmental organization promoting Russian interests.
 
I am sadly silent. And I recall my recent dispute with a Georgian political analyst:
 
- Russia has no allies.
 
“And we don’t need to,” I blink. - There is an army and navy.
 
- You are stuck in the stereotypes of the XIX century. But the US has many allies around the world.
 
“These are vassals,” I object.
 
- Of course. But the Americans serve everything so skillfully that vassals feel equal allies. This is soft power that you do not use. And this is the main mistake of your diplomacy.

GRU AGENTS PETROV AND BOSHIROV DROPPED UNDER US SANCTIONS, AND COMPANIES DERIPASKI RECEIVED AMNESTY

Washington has introduced regular restrictions against Russia.
 
Washington's new sanctions are a response to Russian interference in the US electoral process and a series of cyber attacks. The owners of the "black mark" were 18 Russians and four companies that conduct journalistic activities.
 
15 people from the list, according to the American authorities, agents of the GRU. They are considered to be involved in hacking the correspondence of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton (which later led to her loss).
 
The sanctions were imposed against the news agency Nevskiye Novosti, the publications of the Federal News Agency, Economy Today and the English-language Internet portal USA Really (publishes news about the lives of ordinary Americans: scandals, accidents, funny cases).
 
Alexander Malkevich, the presenter of the program "Do not play the fool, America" ??Radio "Komsomolskaya Pravda" (97.2 FM ), also suited the sanctions . The fact is that the journalist is also the head of the USA Really portal . In November, Malkevich was already confronted with the American authorities — he was detained by FBI officers at the Washington airport and handed a notice to register the publication as a foreign agent.
 
A surprise was the appearance in the American sanctions list of people who became known to the whole world under the names of Ruslan Boshirov and Alexander Petrov.
 
The British authorities believe that the GRU officers are allegedly hiding behind these individuals. They participated in an attempt to poison the British spy Sergey Skripal and his daughter Julia. Apparently, Washington thus decided to support its allies.
 
Also under the sanctions was the former GRU officer Viktor Boyarkin. According to the US authorities, he conducted business negotiations on behalf of businessman Oleg Deripaska (the businessman himself and his companies came under an embargo even earlier). Supposedly, Boyarkin was involved in financing an opposition political party in Montenegro. But despite this, the US Treasury Department plans to lift the restrictions on Russian companies En +, Rusal and Eurosibenergo, which once belonged to Deripaska, in 30 days . At the same time, the businessman himself will remain on the sanctions list, and his assets, in which he owns more than 50%, will still be blocked.
 
“The experience of Oleg Deripaska shows: if you want to remove your property from under sanctions, this can be done only if the property ceases to be yours,” comments economist Mikhail Delyagin. - At the same time, no one guarantees that they will also remove restrictions from you. Deripaska went to all the conditions that the American authorities put forward to him to lift the sanctions. He lowered his stake in the business, transferred management to independent directors, who, by the way, were approved by the US authorities! And now it is still unknown who actually owns and manages major Russian raw materials and energy companies - Washington or a private Russian businessman.

Unemployment in Russia will grow by almost 40 percent

The number of official unemployed in Russia may increase by 38 percent - up to 1.1 million people. This is reported by "Izvestia" with reference to the materials of the Ministry of Labor for the tripartite commission on the regulation of social and labor relations.
 
The increase in the number of officially registered unemployed people was explained by an increase in the size of the unemployment benefit and the retirement age.
 
The amount of the benefit now ranges from 850 rubles to 4.9 thousand rubles, and from January 1 it will be raised to the range from 1.5 thousand to 8 thousand rubles. For citizens of pre-retirement age (men 60-65 years old and women 55-60 years old), the amount of the benefit will be maximum - from 4.9 thousand to 11.3 thousand rubles.
 
At present, in Russia, according to the estimates of the Ministry of Labor, 800,000 registered unemployed, while the total number of citizens who are not working is estimated at 3.6 million people. The latter figure, according to the calculations of the ministry, will not change in the next three years.
 
Earlier, the Ministry of Labor has already announced that an increase in unemployment benefits will lead to a massive registration of Russians at labor exchanges. In the federal budget for 2019, 53.4 billion rubles have been pledged for the payment of benefits.

President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko told who he actually apologized during the summit of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) in St. Petersburg. The words of the head of state are given by the agency BelTA.
 
“I apologized to Nikol [the Acting Prime Minister of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan] that he was attacked there for various reasons. Putin apologized to everyone. In the same place such porridge was ... ", - Lukashenko noted. According to him, the heads of state apologized to each other in a private meeting.
 
According to the Belarusian president, the Russian media distorted the meaning of the incident, presenting the situation as Lukashenko’s apology to Putin for a public skirmish because of the price of Russian gas. “What they are doing: they give a skirmish with Putin in the open air, and then that Lukashenka had to apologize to Putin for speaking with him. God be with you! I would consider my apologies lower than my dignity, ”Lukashenka said.
 
“They [journalists] will surely grab me by the hands there, knowing that I, of course, will not pass by the microphone if a person asks. I respect the journalist, I answer him a question. I say that there was heat there, that I had to apologize to each other, ”Lukashenka concluded.
 
In early December, at the EEU summit in St. Petersburg, Lukashenka argued with Russian President Vladimir Putin about the price at which Russian gas should be supplied to Belarus. In his opinion, Minsk is in less favorable conditions than Berlin. Later, answering a question from journalists, he noted: “I had to apologize later to the host of today's meeting. There was a very vigorous explanation, well, you'd better not hear it. ”

Teresa May has the confidence of the British
Theresa May has retained the post of Prime Minister of Great Britain - her party members have voted to keep her position. 200 conservatives spoke in favor, 117 voted against, reports The Guardian. Now, May’s leadership will not be challenged for a year. May required the support of 158 out of 315 lawmakers to stay in office. As noted, this time the prime minister received one vote more than on the day of her election to the post in 2016. It was also reported that May was not present at the announcement of the results.
 
The leader of the Labor Party, Jeremy Corbin, called the outcome of the vote irrelevant. “The Prime Minister has lost the majority support in parliament, her government is in a state of chaos, and she herself cannot agree on a plan for leaving the European Union, which would be suitable for the country and whose priority would be British jobs and the British economy,” .

West began to put pressure on Norway because of the help of Russia

The head of the gas company NOVATEK and one of the richest people in Russia, Leonid Mikhelson, complained that Western countries had begun to put pressure on the Norwegian authorities because of cooperation with a Russian company. The words of a Russian businessman quoted by Interfax.
 
Mikhelson said that because of the pace of production, NOVATEK had to resort to the help of its Norwegian colleagues, on whose territory the company used the transshipment of liquefied natural gas (LNG). According to Mikhelson, Western countries put pressure on Norway because of the current situation.
 
In this context, the head of the company calls for speeding up the construction of a transshipment terminal in Murmansk, in which the state should invest 900 million rubles. He also called for the construction of the access channel in the Ob Bay not by 2023, but by 2022. “The crucially important issue is the 2022nd, not the 2023, because in 2022 we need to transport the first platform with the liquefaction line from Murmansk to Sabetta,” explained Mikhelson.

Russians want to live well on money from oil. Alaska has been doing this for 40 years.
The cost of the channel, estimated by the Ministry of Transport, is eight billion rubles. The total amount of public investment in the construction of a transshipment terminal is estimated at 100 billion. Without the creation of terminals in Murmansk and Kamchatka, the company will not be able to provide the declared cargo traffic of 80 million tons of LNG by 2024.
 
In this context, Mikhelson requested support from Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev. “We need to provide the necessary funding in the adopted budget for 2019-2021. Critical to the development of LNG projects is the timely development of the icebreaking fleet. It is necessary to ensure year-round circulation in the NSR both in the western and in the eastern direction, ”the head of NOVATEK said, noting that the company expects the help of the Cabinet.
 
NOVATEK is a Russian company engaged in the production and production of LNG. It is currently the second largest gas producer in Russia after Gazprom. The company's founder, chairman of the board, and the largest shareholder is Leonid Mikhelson.

Japanese authorities have banned Chinese manufacturers of smartphones Huawei and ZTE to claim government contracts and participate in public procurement in the territory of their country, TASS reports, citing the Japanese agency Kyodo.
 
The reason for the ban were the concerns of the government regarding the safety of Chinese smartphones and data integrity in them. “It is extremely important for us not to buy equipment that carries malicious functions and can be used to steal information, destroy it, and disrupt information systems,” the words of the Secretary General of the Japanese government, Yoshihide Sugi, are quoted.

Both manufacturers for several months faced problems in the United States. In the summer, local authorities also prohibited them from supplying their equipment to state institutions. In addition to the charges of failure to preserve the data, they are charged with violation of the sanctions regime against the DPRK and Iran. ZTE management made a deal with Washington and changed its key top managers to be able to resume work in a market that the company considers key to itself.
 
In early December, it became known about the detention in Canada of a financial director and the daughter of the founder of Huawei Meng Wangzhou. Its extradition is sought by the United States, suspecting Huawei of working with Iran to bypass sanctions. Later, Wangzhou asked to be released on bail due to health problems.

Russian ships should be banned from entering the ports of the United States and Europe. This was the president of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko said in an interview with Fox News.
 
Such measures must be taken in connection with the incident in the Kerch Strait, the Ukrainian leader believes. “No one knows where Russia will decide to defend its interests tomorrow,” said Poroshenko. According to him, the world community quite seriously reacted to the situation with the detained sailors. Nevertheless, the politician urged to strengthen the response, in particular, to impose sanctions against Russia and to increase the presence of NATO in the Black Sea.
 
On December 5, it became known that the United States was preparing to send a warship to the Black Sea to help Ukraine.

According to its terms, OPEC member countries (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) and 11 foreign countries, including Russia, are committed to reducing production in order to achieve higher prices on the world market.
 
Oil has become cheaper over the past few weeks due to an increase in US stocks, a slowdown in demand growth and market participants' concerns about a possible oversupply. In November, the cost of futures for a barrel of Brent oil fell by 21.6 percent to $ 62.4. This was a record in the last 10 years.

One of the largest US politicians, George H. Bush, died on Friday, November 30, at the age of 94. He died almost eight months after the funeral of Barbara's wife. The 41st president of the country is one of the few who most Americans remember fondly. The collapse of the USSR and the successful operation in the Persian Gulf occurred during his reign. Convinced supporter of the school of realism in foreign policy, he was able to squeeze the Iraqi President Saddam Hussein from Kuwait, but did not finish off the defeated enemy in his homeland, considering that he was acting in accordance with the UN mandate. Against the background of foreign policy victories, the country's economy has failed. Although it was not George who was to blame for this, but his predecessor, Ronald Reagan, voters did not forgive the offense and did not vote for his second term. After retirement, he began collecting funny socks,write memoirs and jump with a parachute. It seemed that George Bush Sr. would always be: in 2017 he became the longest among the former American leaders. About how he was a guy, recalls "Lenta.ru,".
 
“Dear President Bush, my name is Cooper. I just turned five. Last night for dinner we had meat, potatoes and broccoli. My grandmother told me that you do not like broccoli. I want you to know: and I love. I ate my whole batch and another batch of my twin brother. After all, Chase, like you, does not like broccoli. Mr. President, broccoli is very useful for you, I hope you will like it as much as I do. With love, Cooper, ”is one of the letters that the 41st President of the United States received from American children.
 
This reaction was caused by one of his first statements after the inauguration in 1989: “I hate broccoli. I did not love her since childhood, but my mother made me eat it. Now I am the President of the United States and I firmly declare: no more broccoli. ” These words might have seemed amusing to one, but many foreign colleagues saw in this the message that the new owner of the White House had tough principles that he would not compromise.
 
Senator's son
The future head of state was born in the family of a senator and a banker. In many ways, it was this circumstance that influenced the choice of his profession. Since childhood, George wanted to be first in everything. He easily gained prestige among classmates, becoming the president of high school, the secretary of the student council, the captain of sports teams in baseball and football. It seemed that he had enough strength for everything: he studied well, and also raised money for charity and edited a school newspaper.

A year later, Junior Lieutenant George Bush and his team attacked the Japanese on Titichima Island. His plane came under intense anti-aircraft fire and was hit, the engine caught fire. Despite this, the pilot completed the mission, dropping bombs on the target. After that, the crew managed to eject. Parachutes comrades did not open. Bush was lucky: he landed. He spent four hours on an inflatable raft while roars of fighters resounded above him. The young soldier was rescued by the military from the Finback submarine.
 
After that, there were operations in the Philippines: in total, he took part in 58 battles, for which he received the Cross for flying merit, three Air Medals. Bush’s combat experience and talent did not go unnoticed: he was sent to Norfolk Naval Base, where he taught young torpedo pilots. After Japan’s capitulation, he was fired with honors in September 1945.
 
After a successful military service, he married Barbara Pierce and went to Yale University, who was able to graduate in an accelerated program - in 2.5 years. There, as always, he became the center of attention: the best student, the head of the student fraternity, the first baseball player.

The knowledge gained at the institute, Bush decided to apply in the oil business and, without thinking twice, moved his family to Texas. The ties of his father, the former senator, were more convenient than ever : the business flourished, and by the age of 40, George had become a millionaire. Having created his own oil company, he decided that he had reached his maximum in business and it was time to try his hand at big politics.
 
Who lived for many years in Texas, comes from a Republican family, it is not surprising that he joined the Republican Party. Career takeoff did not begin immediately, but things went up when Bush passed to the House of Representatives. At the same time, he acted guided only by what seemed right to him, even if these decisions were contrary to the party line. In particular, he supported the policies of the administration of the 37th President Richard Nixon in Vietnam and voted against birth control, as well as for the abolition of compulsory military conscription.
 
Already in 1970, he tried to break into the Senate, but to no avail. But Nixon noticed him and decided to award the representative of the United States to the UN with a special zeal for special zeal. Bush did a good job with his duties, but he was needed by the head of state - at that moment the Watergate scandal was in full swing - and at the request of Nixon he headed the Republican National Committee. Despite the rapid decline in the rating of the American leader, Bush faithfully defended him from attack. And when Nixon’s guilt became very obvious, he managed to masterfully distance himself from him, while maintaining a good relationship.

It was Bush, as chairman of the Republican National Committee, who demanded that Nixon resign in order to preserve the image of the party. The new president, Gerald Ford, alienated the former pilot from himself, sending him to China. During the 14 months spent there, he managed to improve relations between the countries. Bush, who was returning from a mission, was already awaiting a new leadership position. This time he was to lead the CIA.
 
He faced a difficult task: to restore the reputation of the department after numerous scandals. Bush coped with this. For a year while he was director, the CIA was shaken by a wave of exposures. At that moment many heads flew, including Bush himself. Jimmy Carter - the next head of state - wanted to see his man in this post.

At first, they actually went head to head, but the conservative Reagan liked the voters more than the centrist Bush. Realizing that Monster is losing to Ronald, George sold his house in Houston and bought an estate in Maine, deciding to go there to lick his wounds after losing the presidential race. But luck smiled at him: Reagan chose Bush as his vice-president, defining his future political fate for many years.
 
Funeral diplomacy
He has held the post of vice president for eight years. He was required a little. The main thing is loyalty, learned Bush. If during the pre-election race he sharply criticized Reagan, now he was most afraid to speak about the head of state in a bad way.
 
At that time, he and his wife only had time to attend various events, mainly funerals. This has become a common joke for American comedians. However, such diplomacy has borne fruit: there Bush managed to establish contacts with many foreign leaders and future heads of state. By the way, it was he who represented the American delegation at the funeral of the Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev in Moscow.

Reagan did not regret that he chose Bush; he was surprisingly faithful. In 1981, just two months after taking office, the president gave a speech at the Hilton Hotel. When the head of state was already leaving the hotel, a certain John Hinckley Jr. approached him and shot a revolver six times. Three people from the entourage of the president were injured. One of the bullets hit Reagan’s lung. The head of state was taken to hospital and urgently operated on.
 
At this point, Bush was in Dallas and was forced to immediately return to Washington. It was necessary to convene a cabinet meeting as soon as possible, and Bush’s assistants advised him to go directly to the White House by helicopter. However, the vice-president refused, saying that “only the head of state can land on the South lawn”.
 
Reagan's inner circle told that the president liked the answer from Bush, and since then he began to dine with him regularly in the Oval Office on Thursdays. In 1984, the Reagan-Bush couple decided to re-nominate themselves for re-election and won again.
 
Two years later, the administration was in the center of a major international scandal. It turned out that some officials secretly sold weapons to Iran, with which diplomatic relations were broken back in 1980, immediately after the founding of the Islamic Republic. The money went to finance the anti-communist group Contra in Nicaragua. When this information was leaked to the media, Reagan and Bush rushed to distance themselves from what had happened, saying that they had no idea what was going on. The vague explanations of Bush were not convinced by the public; very soon he was reputed to be a coward among the people. An interview on CBS television, in which the vice president defended his innocence, and at the same time the innocence of President Reagan, helped to regain his lost reputation.
 
Overlooking the White House
In 1988, he again tried his luck at the presidential election. Teamwork Reagan, on the one hand, was his trump card, on the other - Bush on the background of the charismatic Ronald strongly lost. He was often criticized for his lack of speaking skills compared to the former president. However, George was able to get together and read his famous speech at the Republican Party Convention, which went down in history as the Thousand Colors of Light.

In it, the Republican described his vision of America’s future. He supported the oath of allegiance to the American flag (the oath of US citizens in allegiance to their country, pronounced in front of the flag of the country), advocated the death penalty, the right to own weapons and against abortion. As a result, the Americans believed the policy and gave him a chance.
 
The Bush presidency fell on a difficult time for the whole world: the collapse of the USSR, the fall of the Berlin Wall. In Russia, they believe that it was he who drove the last nail into the coffin of the Soviet Union. It was Bush who immediately after the signing of the Belovezhsky Agreement on December 8, 1991, was called by Boris Yeltsin. Two weeks later, a call from Mikhail Gorbachev rang out in the White House: this happened right before he officially resigned from the presidency of the USSR.
 
Gulf War
In 1991, American tanks entered Baghdad. The reason for this was the invasion of Iraq in Kuwait in August 1990. Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein accused the emirate of stealing oil from border fields, as well as participating in an anti-Iraqi conspiracy. American politicians in the days of Reagan were inclined to impose sanctions against Baghdad, but the president himself opposed this: Iraq bought food from Washington and also actively opposed the main US opponent in the Middle East - Iran.
 
Hussein was sure that the Americans would support him this time too. But he was wrong: Bush decided not to participate in the Arab inter-party squad, taking a sharply anti-Iraq stance. As a result of the ground operation, Desert Storm, Kuwait was liberated. Saddam Hussein was humbled: on February 28, 1991, he announced a cease-fire and Iraq’s acceptance of all UN requirements. Baghdad has lost all stocks of chemical and bacteriological weapons. However, the coalition forces led by the United States did not begin to overthrow the Iraqi dictator: George Bush, who turned to the citizens of the country from television screens, called on Iraqis to do it themselves. Looking ahead, it is worth noting that subsequently the son of Iraq, George W. Bush, who will become the 43rd US president, will deal with the Iraqi dictator Hussein.
 
The Americans rated Bush’s venture - his ratings reached a record 89 percent. However, success in foreign policy has been replaced by disappointment in domestic policy. The economic recession and high taxes, from which Bush had promised to save America during the election campaign, as well as markedly increased unemployment, caused a sharp drop in his rating. As a result, in the elections of 1992, Bill Clinton was elected head of state, while Bush Sr. remained president of one term.

Subsequently, ill-wishers will recall to him the famous speech delivered on August 1, 1991 in the capital of Ukraine and received the ironic name “Chicken Kiev”. In it, Bush Sr. warned Ukrainians about the danger of “suicidal nationalism” a few months before the referendum and the declaration of independence of Ukraine. Opponents of the president blamed him for not trying to get the most out of the victory over communism: "If Reagan was in your place, he would have marked this historic event, showing off in front of the American public."
 
After leaving big politics, Bush began writing memoirs, collecting funny socks. He occasionally appeared in public, and also from the age of 75, once every five years, jumped with a parachute, marking the next anniversary. His vast political experience later came in handy for his sons. George W. Bush will become the 43rd president, and his youngest son Jeb will be the governor of Florida, but then he will fail miserably in the 2016 presidential race.

Spetskor "KP" Daria ASLAMOVA transmits from a country where they have just decided on the president.
 
In Georgia, all 100 percent of the votes are counted. Salome Zurabishvili, supported by the ruling party, gained 59.52%. Opposition candidate Grigol Vashadze won only 40.48% of the vote. What awaits the country with a new leader and how will this affect the relationship with Russia?
 
- Well, what are you talking about, Sergo ?! What other vows on the Koran? In Georgia? - I say.
 
- Have you forgotten that we have 300 thousand Azerbaijanis? And there are Turks. They were forced to swear on the Koran that they would vote for Salome Zurabishvili and gave free pita bread and food. Bribe, in a word. Sergo - one of the gang of taxi drivers that are on duty under my windows. But they already understood that you could not cook porridge with me, but we all became friends. I am not a wealthy Russian tourist who will ask to travel around beautiful places. Although now Russians are respected here, and everyone in Tbilisi immediately remembered "the great and mighty." Even in the streets and in the cafe you can hear Russian music (when Saakashvili was paid a fine for it, I am a witness!).
 
- Sergo, you voted for Vashadze, a supporter of Saakashvili. Do you really like this crazy?
 
- Not at all. But he rebuilt the entire infrastructure. Here I like your Sobyanin. See how Moscow rebuilt! We would have such. And why do we need the billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili, who says with tears on TV: "I know that you did not begin to live better. But we will correct. We will pay your debts." He will not pay anything. But Saakashvili still has a lot of supporters. About 10% of the population are pure fanatics. For them, he is the new Stalin. The split is so great that the winning party "Georgian Dream" even refrains from mass celebrations in order not to annoy people.
 
- Yes, it is not customary for us to say: “Let me disagree with you,” political analyst Nika Chitadze is laughing. - Here everything is on passions and knives. Even our families break up due to political views. But under Saakashvili, the country began to shine, the economy grew sharply, finished with domestic gangsterism. He even managed to hold out for five days in the war against a nuclear power - Russia!
 
It makes me laugh.
 
- Nick, what are you talking about! Our warriors stood under Tbilisi, and only the pleading requests of Bush and Sarkozy forced us to retreat. And what kind of prosperity are you talking about? Two million people fled from Georgia in search of work. And half of them in Russia.
 
- It can not be! - indignant Nick. (Under the USSR, Georgia’s population was 5.5 million people, now 3.5 million, with some of them also migrant workers. - Auth.). But for Nika Chitadze, Saakashvili’s adventurer is still a great ruler. And all the arrests, murders, extortion in which he and his associates are accused are just excesses. New President Salome Zurabishvili, a Frenchwoman of Georgian origin, she clearly does not like:
 
- She allows herself tactless expressions: I am supposedly a European and I will teach Georgians to be Europeans. Many people are hurt. Yes, indeed, Salome is a secular, refined, sensible daughter of Georgian immigrants. Detractors tease her for the French accent. Before the elections, she refused French citizenship, although she made a brilliant career in France (for more details, see the “Call to Expert” rubric). Outwardly, she is disposed towards benevolent relations with Russia, but do not flatter yourself - this is the “NATO girl” (or, as the Georgians joke, “NATO with a human face”). Yes, she admitted that in 2008 Georgia started the war with Russia, but she could not do otherwise. After all, this fact is recognized and the European Commission. But is it easier for Russia?
 
“Both candidates adhere to the same pro-Western course,” says journalist Valery Kvaratskhelia. - So the Americans won anyway. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Georgia also crumbled in every sense - territorially, economically and spiritually. And we still insist that our salvation is the West. Imposing and mocking Gulbaat Rtskhiladze, head of the Institute of Eurasia, notes:
 
“The Georgians can only succeed as part of a large empire. They flourished in Byzantium. In the Muslim empires, we could not resist: a different religion and way of life. But in Russia and in the USSR just got up. Top - Joseph Stalin. Well, where else could a simple beggar seminarian Joseph Stalin reach such heights ?! We were lucky in our time: both of the faithful and the mentality came together. We often quarrel, but we are drawn to each other. As soon as Saakashvili was removed, immediately people from Russia reached out here. But we have a state installation (and this is encouraged by the West) that we must remember all the bad things about the Soviet past. And until it changes, I do not see the light at the end of the tunnel.
 
CALLER EXPERT
 
What now wait for Russia?
 
- Salome Zurabishvili was born in 1952 in France into a family of political immigrants. And she is a diplomat by education, - told KP, senior researcher at RISI, an expert on Georgia Konstantin Tasits. - For a long time worked in the French Foreign Ministry in various positions. And her last position is the French ambassador to Georgia. In 2004, Saakashvili invited her to head the Georgian Foreign Ministry. At that time, she demonstrated a strong character and independence. She did not like the way the opposition was suppressed and the freedom of speech was restricted. This led to Zurabishvili leaving the team of Saakashvili and even began to act against him. Of course, she is a supporter of the integration of Georgia into Europe and NATO. However, Salome thinks pragmatically. As for relations with Russia, let me remind you that the powers of the President of Georgia have been largely curtailed. That is, it will perform representative functions and is unlikely to be able to greatly influence the country's foreign policy. Therefore, there is nothing new to wait for. It is obvious that cooperation in the economic and humanitarian areas will continue. However, the political contradictions between Moscow and Tbilisi will remain. This is especially true of the status of Abkhazia and North Ossetia and the possible entry of Georgia into NATO.

Four days before the meeting with PRC Chairman Xi Jinping in Argentina, Trump described as “extremely unlikely” the prospect that he would wait at the request of China with another increase in duties, scheduled for January 1, 2019.
 
According to him, perhaps only an agreement by which China will open the country for American goods. Trump also said that if negotiations with the Chinese leader are not crowned with success, he will impose duties on all the remaining Chinese imports. New duties may affect imported from China laptops and iPhones, which are not yet subject to tariffs.
 
In early November, Trump announced that at the G-20 summit in Argentina he wanted to conclude a trade agreement with Xi Jinping. Sources close to the White House regarded this as the first step towards ending a trade war between countries.

Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev signed decrees aimed at protecting the interests of Russian banks, credit organizations and non-bank credit organizations that are under foreign sanctions. Documents posted on the website of the Russian government.
 
In order to protect the interests of Russian banks and credit organizations and “counter the illegal sanctions pressure”, they were allowed not to disclose information. In particular, it has been established that a bank can exercise this right if, in relation to persons “under the control or significant influence of which it is located”, restrictive measures have been introduced.
 
The same privileges apply if members of the bank’s board of directors or some management representatives are subject to sanctions.
 
However, organizations must themselves submit this information to the Bank of Russia and justify why they made such a decision.

America loosened the oil market. How will Russia respond?
Experts predict that after the seizure of the Ukrainian ships in the Kerch Strait, Moscow will face new sanctions and another collapse of the ruble exchange rate.
 
In January of this year, the US Treasury Department prepared a list of 210 Russian high-ranking officials and businessmen to whom sanctions can be applied. They are not allowed to cooperate with American individuals and legal entities. The people for whom sanctions have been imposed cannot have bank accounts in dollars or other currencies if the transactions of the bank that keeps their savings go through the United States.
 
Sanctions against individuals and organizations from Russia also apply in the European Union. They include freezing of accounts and restrictions on movement and apply to 155 people and 44 organizations.

Belarus will not support the proposal to once again extend the terms of the current standards for the distribution of the amounts of import customs duties. This was stated by President Alexander Lukashenko, BelTA reports.
 
The head of Belarus at a meeting with the leaders of the member states of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), said that the issue of calculating the standards for the distribution of the amounts of import customs duties is still open.
 
The proposal once again extends the terms of existing standards, as Lukashenko stressed, is absolutely unprofitable for Belarus and puts the country in unequal conditions in relation to other members of the EAEU. In his opinion, you need to find a fair solution.
 
“It is clear to everyone. And here, probably, there should be less politics, but still more economy, ”the head of state emphasized.
 
The norms of customs duties are established by the agreement of April 11, 2017. According to it, Belarus receives 4.56 percent from duties, Kazakhstan - 7.055 percent, Kyrgyzstan - 1.9 percent, Russia - 85.265 percent, and 1.22 percent comes to the Armenian budget. On May 14, 2018, the validity of these standards was extended until December 31, 2019.

China must radically change its policy if it wants to avoid a “total cold war” with the United States and its partners. This was stated by US Vice President Mike Pence in an interview with The Washington Post.
 
According to him, China needs to carry out "large-scale changes in its economic, military and political activities." Pence noted that Beijing’s last chance to avoid the Cold War scenario will depend on the outcome of negotiations between US President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in Argentina.

According to the American Vice President, his country's economy is strong enough to withstand such an escalation, while the Chinese economy is not so stable. “We really believe that we are in a winning position anyway,” concluded Pence.
 
At the end of October, the former commander of US forces in Europe, General Ben Hodges, suggested that the United States and China could unleash a war in 15 years.

The US sanctions against Iran turned out to be advantageous for Russia and brought the country benefits. It is reported by The Wall Street Journal.
 
Restrictive measures have allowed Moscow to discourage buyers from Tehran and increase the supply of oil. Russia helps Iran overcome the negative effects of sanctions and buys its oil for domestic consumption. Liberated as a result of this, the country’s own energy resources are being exported, primarily to Europe.

Better deal no worse
Is it possible to reset in the relationship of Iran and the United States
The publication writes that Russia plans to continue to buy oil from Iran, but is going to use barter. In exchange for oil, Tehran will receive production equipment and food products.
 
Earlier, Iranian Oil Minister Bizhan Namdar Zangane predicted for Iranian oil buyers difficult months in connection with the sanctions. According to him, even temporary permits to import Iranian oil issued by the United States will not be able to resolve the situation. Nevertheless, the newspaper notes that South Korea, China and Turkey have already been able to varying degrees to compensate for the reduction in the supply of Iranian oil at the expense of Russia's energy resources.
 
The second package of US sanctions against Tehran entered into force on 5 November. The bans affected oil exports, the banking sector and shipping. At the same time, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani announced that he would fight with US restrictive measures. "America wanted to bring Iranian oil to zero, but we will continue to sell our oil to break through sanctions," the politician said.
 
Relations between the United States and Iran escalated after Donald Trump announced in early May that Washington was unilaterally withdrawing from the 2015 nuclear deal and resuming sanctions against Tehran.

The authorities are ready, if necessary, to support large companies that are subject to sanctions. This was announced by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, RBC reports.
 
According to him, in the case of new restrictions, “nothing critical will happen.” “But all this is unpleasant and, of course, will force us to make certain decisions, if necessary, including the support of individual large companies if they are under such sanctions,” he added.
 
The prime minister spoke on the topic of sanctions the day after the statement by the US State Department about the intention to introduce a second package of sanctions against Russia for non-compliance with the American law on the elimination of chemical weapons. The case in point is the accusation of the use of the Novice military toxic agent in the British Salisbury, which Moscow categorically denies.
 
For the first time the intention of Washington to introduce regular anti-Russian sanctions became known in September. It was assumed that they will come into force in November and will affect banks, the purchase of defense goods, as well as the provision of financial assistance.
 
In particular, the United States will no longer issue licenses for the export of weapons and dual-use products to Russia, with the exception of exports in the space industry and in the field of civil aviation. Also announced the termination of any US assistance to Russia, except for emergency humanitarian aid, food and other agricultural products.

Russia and China in the near future should increase trade turnover by half. This was stated by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, RBC reports.
 
“We are able to increase trade turnover very significantly, and such a goal has been set. You can talk [...] at least about doubling trade. China is still Russia's largest trading partner, ”said Medvedev.
 
According to the Prime Minister, for the first time in history, the trade turnover between countries can overcome the $ 100 billion mark. He also noted that interaction with China is important in the context of "the difficulties that our economies face because of the unfriendly actions of a number of countries."
 
“We really need to combine efforts to ensure that international regulation in this area is maintained. Moreover, it was optimized and developed, ”the Prime Minister concluded.
 
According to the Federal Customs Service, in 2017 the trade turnover of Russia and China amounted to 87 billion dollars.

14 percent of companies are not afraid to get under sanctions, 86 percent are concerned about this prospect. The most likely scenario is the restriction of Russia's access to Western goods or technologies. Also, business fears of currency fluctuations and a possible ban on foreign exchange transactions for state banks.

US President Donald Trump wants to reach an agreement on trade with Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the G 20 summit in Argentina, Bloomberg reported, citing sources.
 
Trump has already commissioned key officials to work out the terms of the agreement. According to sources close to the White House, this can be regarded as the first step towards ending a trade war between countries.
 
The situation was broken by Trump's phone calls with Xi Jinping. These were the first negotiations in half a year for the heads of the two countries that were publicly announced. The parties stated that they constructively discussed the situation in North Korea and trade relations. The President of the United States said that the conversation was "long and very good." Chinese media reported that the American leader supported an “honest, open discussion,” in particular, discussed possible talks in Argentina.
 
Previously, Trump supported a rather aggressive policy towards China. Back in October, he said that he would not stop and was ready to strike at the economy of the PRC much stronger. “We have already achieved a tremendous effect. Their economy has gone down at a very confident pace, I have opportunities to strengthen this, if I want it, ”said Trump. At the same time, he made a reservation that he did not want an escalation and hoped that China would be able to start negotiations. However, the American leader did not miss the opportunity to once again accuse Beijing of dishonest trade war, which, in his opinion, the PRC has long led against the United States.




 






 
 
Will the states throw Russia out of the oil and gas market?

Some experts believe that this is the ultimate goal of Western sanctions. The first went. Poland has concluded a 20-year contract with the United States for the supply of liquefied gas from there. And German Chancellor Angela Merkel, according to sources from the Wall Street Journal , promised to financially support the construction of a terminal in the territory of this neighboring state. The Americans are trying to take the European gas market from Russia. And their ultimate goal, according to some experts, is to squeeze the super-profits from the sale of oil from Russia.
 
What is it: paranoia or a real danger to the country?
 
AGAIN $ 100?
 
The oil and gas market in the last year pleases the head of the Ministry of Finance, Anton Siluanov, and ordinary citizens. Oil is relatively expensive - budget revenues are growing, the economy is strengthening. And there are all the prerequisites that in the near future the barrel will reach a symbolic $ 100.
 
Several factors work for it at once. The most important is sanctions against Iran. From November 4, oil exports will be banned for it. It is expected that the global market will lose up to 2 million barrels per day - approximately 2%.
 
For comparison, the world's largest exporters - Russia, Saudi Arabia and the United States - produce 10 to 11 million barrels every day. Therefore, after Iran’s departure from the commodity market, the oil shortage will not be catastrophic, but it will still be.
 
Plus, fuel to the fire is poured by the problems of two other exporters of oil: Venezuela’s impending default and political problems in Saudi Arabia, caused by the killing of a local dissident and journalist, Jamal Hashkaji. This further pushes the price of the barrel up.
 
On the one hand, expensive oil is good for our budget. This year, he will have a surplus of more than $ 2 trillion anyway. rubles. On the other hand, it is they who can push the US to even more radical measures in relation to Russia.
 
RAW SANCTIONS
 
There has been a lot of noise over the last four years around the anti-Russian sanctions of the United States, but in reality they were relatively toothless. However, it is too early to relax. Many experts believe that the main goal of Americans is to take away our most important source of income.
 
How?
 
Yes, to introduce raw sanctions against Russia: to prohibit the world from buying our oil and gas. As it was and is happening with Iran. In this case, we are waiting for a serious crisis.
 
- Due to the close relationship between the exchange rate of the Russian ruble and the hydrocarbon trade, the entire economy of the country will very quickly go to the bottom. Most likely, the collapse of the ruble on the stock exchanges will happen just at the very announcement of such sanctions, - predicted by American economists, “Sovietologists” Christopher Hartwell and Andreas Umland. - Enterprises will quickly adapt their behavior to the changed situation, which will entail a real cascade of capital outflows, withdrawals, cancellation of projects and much more. The Russian economy will simply not survive this, and the country will experience an acute economic crisis.
 
Russian experts believe that while fearing commodity sanctions is not worth it. But just for now.
 
- It is possible to replace Iranian oil, and ours is very difficult. Russian oil supplies are many times larger. Plus a third of Europe is completely dependent on our gas, ” explains economist Sergei Khestanov. - But after two or three years, the situation may change. Americans are increasing shale oil production, building liquefied natural gas plants and shipping terminals. In Europe, building receiving terminals. As construction progresses and production increases, the United States will begin to impose commodity restrictions against us.
 
The calculation here is obvious. If such a large player as Russia leaves the commodity market, this will lead to a sharp increase in oil and gas prices. Here more expensive (including delivery) American hydrocarbons will be able to enter the European market.
 
EUROPE SWAN, CANCER AND PITCH IN EUROPE
 
While in the Old World there is no consensus, "whose gas station is better" - American or Russian.
 
- The motivation of Poland is clear. She is trying to mediate between the United States and her European neighbors. That is, to get gas from there and resell it to others, says
 
Sergey Pikin, Director of the Energy Development Fund.
 
Now such a country is Germany. She gets the lion's share of gas coming from Russia,
 
heats himself, charges a transit fee and ensures supplies to other countries. It is clear that Angela Merkel, despite all the political differences, is behind the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline under construction.
 
However, experts doubt that Europe may ever give up on our gas. Too great dependence.
 
- It’s physically impossible to replace us completely. Volumes are not comparable. This year we will supply about 200 billion cubic meters of gas to the European market. In the US, there is simply no such volume for export. And all the talk about it - this is a game of the buyer. Europe scares us, trying to knock out a better price - sure
 
Sergey Pikin.
 
For example, the mentioned contract with Poland is only 2 million tons of liquefied natural gas, or 2.7 billion cubic meters per year. This is slightly more than 1% of all European supplies of Gazprom. The share of renewable energy sources, all kinds of wind turbines, is growing every year, but they are unlikely to be able to replace the base resource.
 
- The only thing Europe can do is to keep the share of Russian gas in imports at the level of 33% of the last forces. This is a long-standing strategic task that was set 50 years ago. And it is being observed, ”explains Rustam Tankayev, chairman of the Union of Oil and Gas Producers of Russia. - Europe needs Russian gas. First, it is the cheapest. It is important. Secondly, the Europeans reject nuclear energy and replace it with gas. Its sources in Europe are declining, the need for imports is growing.
 
BTW
 
... and a little about China
 
The threat that the European Union may refuse Russian gas has been sounding in the background for several years now. But real progress in this direction yet.
 
On the contrary, year after year, Europe is only increasing volumes from Russia. However, to reduce risks, the state is looking for new, reliable buyers. That was China. And even if Europe does not give up our gas, the extra customer will not hurt.
 
To this end, Gazprom is building the Power of Siberia gas pipeline with a length of as much as 4,000 kilometers. China is actively refusing coal-fired power plants. The country has introduced an environmental program - the authorities of the Celestial Empire allocate tens of billions of dollars to it. Including plans to increase the share of gas in the energy sector. At the first stage, it is planned that we will supply the Chinese with 38 billion cubic meters of gas per year. And further, as infrastructure develops, volumes may increase. Bonus to risk insurance here and the ability to develop remote deposits. For example, Chayandinskoe in Yakutia and Kovykta in
 
Irkutsk region.

The head of Rosneft, Igor Sechin, believes that the realities of world business policy differ sharply from the constructive work of building up the common interests of countries.
 
Chief Executive Officer of the Rosneft Oil Company, Igor Sechin, made a keynote speech at the XI Eurasian Economic Forum in Verona (Italy), devoted to the “Economics of business trust and diplomacy from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean” The conference was attended by representatives of business circles, political and public figures, diplomats and experts. "We are witnessing historical time for the global energy industry," said Igor Sechin. But, in his opinion, today's realities of world economic policy are sharply at variance with the constructive work of building the common interests of the "economy of trust".
 
"TREASURY WARS"
 
Igor Sechin began his presentation with the most pressing issue today - trade restrictions and sanctions, which in many ways became an instrument of struggle from the United States for a share in key world markets.
 
An analysis of the grounds for the introduction of sanctions suggests that their use is actually a tool to exert pressure on individual states in order to force them to change their domestic and foreign policy in one-sided interests, rather than a measure of international legal responsibility for companies.
 
“In my opinion, there are no sanctions, but“ treasury wars ”with deliberately vague - often ambiguous - formulations. The arbitrariness in their application has already become obvious to everyone,” noted Igor Sechin. According to him, about a third of world reserves and one fifth of world oil production have already been subjected to unilateral restrictions, which is an unconditional anti-record.
 
ROUTINE TOOL
 
The sanctions imposed without the necessary decisions of the UN Security Council have become a routine instrument in the hands of one country, while not only individual market actors but also a number of countries are hostages of the situation.
 
"Under these conditions, there is no place for equal dialogue, and the only advice I can give to our partners is to prepare for dictation, the result of the policy of unilateral sanctions will be the loss of a significant part of sovereignty and control over your economic, energy policy by many market participants," said Igor Sechin.
 
The USA accounted for only about 0.6% of the losses from the sanctions imposed against Russia, while Germany accounted for as much as 40%, the head of the Russian company believes. The refusal of all European companies to work with Iranian partners, which is currently under discussion, can also have serious consequences for the European economy, the head of Rosneft noted in his speech.
 
MARKET BALANCE
 
The US Treasury Wars may lead to a serious imbalance in the oil market in the near future, Igor Sechin believes.
 
"The current demand and supply of liquid hydrocarbons in the world market is generally balanced at around 100 million barrels per day. However, maintaining stability and balance cannot be called a long-term trend, since the oil market has not yet formed an instrument to ensure such stability," Rosneft.
 
In his opinion, the current level of free capacity is the lowest in a decade, and there is a direct threat that it will not be able to recover production capacity, which is mainly due to the fault of the US administration.
 
What happened in 2014 - 2017 Reduced investment in the industry due to falling oil prices will have serious consequences for the industry. However, Rosneft, unlike other companies, continued to actively invest in exploration and production during this period. "In fact, we have increased by 50%, and in dollar terms - p from 9.2 billion dollars in 2014 to 13.7 billion dollars in 2017.
 
As a result, in the next 18 months we are launching more than 7 world-class new mining projects, which once again testifies to our commitment to a stable world market, "Sechin said
 
Russia, in his opinion, will not leave the world oil arena in 10 to 15 years, as some have predicted. According to Igor Sechin, in this perspective, there will be three current largest players - Saudi Arabia, Russia and the United States.
 
The position of the head of Rosneft, Igor Sechin, was supported by other participants in the discussion. Thus, according to Romano Prodi, the former head of the Council of Ministers of Italy, as a result of the US sanctions policy, European countries may be the main victims. The current dynamics of European trade today already indicate that Europe is moving towards self-isolation, Prodi said.
 
"Increasing market volatility is an objective reality, and there will be more and more, I will not say" speculations ", but more and more uncertainties. This increasing volatility has a negative effect on companies. And, as has been noted here, there are certain limitations in terms of raw flows of oil. They are due to the mechanisms that upset the balance in the market, and a chain reaction may occur when new restrictions are introduced and countermeasures are taken, ”said Glencore's Chief Executive Officer, Ayva Mr. Glasenberg.
 
The head of BP Robert Dudley, in turn, stressed that the state of the oil markets in terms of sanctions creates risks for the global economy. According to him, by 2040, the demand for energy will be much higher than now. "We do not know how US sanctions will affect the situation with Iranian oil, but according to the available data, there will be a decrease of 1 million every day," Dudley said. This, in his opinion, creates risks for the world economy, so the question of sanctions, he is sure, requires an early decision.
 
This opinion is shared by the chairman of the board of directors of Intesa Bank, Professor Antonio Fallico. He summarized the discussion, saying that he would appeal to the government and people of Italy not to support the mechanical extension of the sanctions in December.

Rosneft chief executive officer Igor Sechin delivered a keynote speech at the XI Eurasian Economic Forum in Verona, the company told Lente.ru.
 
Igor Sechin began his presentation with the most pressing issue today - trade restrictions and sanctions, which in many ways became an instrument of struggle from the United States for a share in key world markets. “Today, they have become so diverse, so rapidly growing, that they acquire a new quality. An analysis of the grounds for imposing sanctions suggests that their use is actually a tool to exert pressure on individual states in order to force them to change their internal and external policies for unilateral interests, rather than a measure of international legal responsibility for economic entities, ” the head of Rosneft. “In my opinion, there are not sanctions, but" treasury wars "with deliberately vague - often ambiguous - formulations.The arbitrariness in their use has already become obvious to all, ”said Igor Sechin.
 
According to him, about a third of world reserves and one fifth of world oil production have already been subjected to unilateral restrictions, which is an unconditional anti-record. The sanctions imposed without the necessary decisions of the UN Security Council have become a routine instrument in the hands of one country, while not only individual market actors but also a number of countries are hostages of the situation. The USA accounted for only about 0.6 percent of the losses from the sanctions imposed on Russia, while Germany accounted for as much as 40 percent.

“Apparently, the United States has its own vision of its role in this process, they gladly live in the role of regulator of the world oil market, being guided by far from market methods and their own, far from disinterested interests,” the Rosneft head noted. Given that OPEC has reduced its share of the global oil market in favor of the US shale industry, we can now speak of the emergence of the US-PEC structure. In his opinion, the current level of free capacity is the lowest in a decade, and there is a direct threat that it will not be able to recover production capacity, which is mainly due to the fault of the US administration.
 
At the same time, as the head of Rosneft noted, over the past 30 years, the volume of barrier-free world trade has grown by 65 percent - to $ 18.3 trillion, which has contributed to global economic growth. However, the current actions of the United States, the head of Rosneft noted, give a clear line aimed at maintaining their own market through the use of protectionist measures and sanctions. According to the estimates of the leading world economists, trade wars will cost the world GDP 0.5-0.8 percent - about 400-700 billion dollars a year.
 
At the same time, he expressed confidence that "win-win" mutually beneficial relations will continue to successfully develop, while further scaling of sanctions restrictions, paradoxically, limits the United States itself, since the unilateral refusal of them to comply with international law and the reluctance to comply with the decisions of international institutions, a demonstrative way out of the agreements or the requirement to revise them solely in their own interests makes them an increasingly less reliable and equal partner and ultimately ivodit to a loss of credibility on the part of other countries. " “The loss of trust in the United States is another example of the fact that the rest of the world, that is, more than 95 percent of the world's population, is already looking for an alternative to the current model. I think that we need a system of mutual dialogue,built on the basis of trust and respect, ”said the head of the oil company.
 
The current level of oil prices, Sechin noted, is comfortable for the company and, in general, largely reflects the existing balance of supply and demand. Speaking about market prospects, the head of Rosneft once again warned market participants against excessive optimism about the prospects for electric vehicles. In the foreseeable future, oil and gas will remain the core of the global energy and economy, and the main challenge for the coming decades will be the replenishment of the old resources with the outgoing old capacity - in the amount of up to 40 million barrels per day by 2040.
 
At the same time, relying on further growth of shale production is not worth it, the company's head noted, since it is fraught with technical and technological difficulties and will not be able to compensate for the natural decline in production from traditional projects.
 
Sechin also noted that the decline in investment in the industry in 2014-2017 due to the fall in oil prices will have serious consequences for the industry. However, Rosneft, unlike other companies, continued to actively invest in exploration and production during this period. “We have, in fact, increased by 50 percent, and in dollar terms, from 9.2 billion dollars in 2014 to 13.7 billion dollars in 2017,” said Sechin.

“Common sense won. The mind triumphed, ”with these words on December 8, 1987, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU Mikhail Gorbachev marked the signing of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Short-Range Missiles (INF) between Moscow and Washington. According to US President Ronald Reagan, who was then President, the agreement was "a great example of a reward for patience." The document was called a political breakthrough and a great victory, a groundwork, the first step towards a peaceful future. Now, however, the hopes of previous generations seem to be shattered: the current American leader announced the coming withdrawal from the treaty. Are peace and security really shaken up, sorted out Lenta.ru.
 
To be or not to be?
“We are going to terminate the agreement. And then we will develop weapons until Russia and China agree to a new deal, ”Donald Trump said on October 20 to his supporters in the US state of Nevada. He accused Moscow of violating the treaty for many years and stated that it should have been broken even earlier.
 
For some hours before, plans to withdraw from the agreement mentioned and Adviser to the President of the United States on national security, John Bolton. The same news, according to media reports, he intended to personally tell the Russian authorities and Russian President Vladimir Putin during his current visit to Moscow.
 
At a press conference following the trip, the adviser said that at the meetings he had discussed in detail issues related to arms control, as well as about Trump’s decision on the treaty, but not about the consequences. According to him, "the threat is not the exit of the United States, but the threat that there are already Russian ballistic missiles in Europe." At the same time, he pointed out that Washington has not yet transmitted a note on the withdrawal from DRDMT to Moscow.
 
It was also reported that the final decision, it seems, has not yet been made, since a number of key State Department and Pentagon employees oppose this initiative, and it is not clear whether the President can make such a decision on his own.

There , here , back
The statement, as well as previous decisions Trump (whether out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or the beginning of a trade war with China), it was quite sharp, but not something so unexpected. Since 2013, the United States has been constantly making claims to Russia about the violation of the INF Treaty.
 
Washington claims that Moscow developed, assembled, tested and put into service a missile with an index of 9M729, having a range of from 500 to 5500 kilometers, which is contrary to the agreement. In this regard, the US side stated that there is a “legal basis” for termination of the contract, and also allocated funding - $ 50 million - to develop a mobile system with cruise missiles of forbidden range.

Allegedly deployed, as if violated
What the Americans are again haunted by Iskander

New. Cold Yours
The confrontation between the USA and Russia develops into an implicit war
Russia also indicates that the 9M729 was not developed or tested for a distance of more than 500 kilometers, and therefore does not violate anything. Although some experts point out that the discussion in the INFMT is not about testing, but about immediate characteristics, so if a rocket is able to fly farther than 500 kilometers, then it must still fall under restrictions.
 
However, not only Washington has claims to the second side. According to Moscow, modern American missile defense systems, including those currently deployed on the territory of many US allies in NATO, can launch not only anti-missiles, but also attack cruise missiles. Moscow is also dissatisfied with the withdrawal of the shock drone from under the agreement and the use of target rockets in testing rocket launchers.
 
In this regard, Russia has repeatedly been noted: of course, we don’t want to break the contract, but a mirror response will follow the US decision. At the same time, the military declared that new weapons would not make themselves wait.
 
Great breakthrough
The arms race broke out in the second half of the 1970s, when the United States and the USSR began to deploy their nuclear weapons in Europe. The Soviet "European strategic" Pioneer complexes and the American medium- range groups with the ballistic Pershing-2 and the winged Tomahawks stood ready; they were separated by only a few minutes of flight.

It was not too comfortable to be under constant sight and expect a strike that would simply smash the command centers. And the parties began negotiations. Initially, the USSR insisted not only on the elimination of medium-range missiles in Europe and the reduction of strategic nuclear forces, but also on the United States abandoning the space anti-missile program. However, by 1987, the missiles were allocated in a separate unit, and then agreements were reached on a “global zero”: not only medium-range but also short-range missiles should be not only removed from Europe, but also destroyed.
 
The INF Treaty has become key during the Cold War. The parties acknowledged: "A nuclear war would have destructive consequences for all mankind." As a result, for the first time in history, a document was adopted that allowed, in fact, to destroy a whole class of weapons.
 
By agreement, the United States and the USSR have committed themselves not to produce, test or deploy ballistic and cruise ground-based missiles of medium (from 1,000 to 5,500 kilometers) and short (from 500 to 1,000 kilometers) range. At the same time, similar sea-based and air-launched missiles were not included in the document. In addition, the parties for three years pledged to destroy all launchers and ground-based missiles with a radius of action from 500 to 5,500 kilometers. To monitor the implementation of each party could conduct inspections.

The contract was completed in full by June 1991. The United States decommissioned missiles and equipment, including at sites in the UK, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands, and the USSR in the GDR and Czechoslovakia. In total, 846 American and 1846 Soviet missiles were destroyed.
 
The contract has no expiration date, so after the collapse of the USSR, practical implementation in addition to Russia and the United States also carried out Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine.
 
Dump history?
Perhaps, the main problem with the INF Treaty is: is it relevant in the modern world in principle? The parties to the document now adhere to the established rules , and no one imposed restrictions on other countries. Yes, in October 2007, Russia and the United States united and took the initiative in the UN General Assembly to extend the agreement to the whole world, but it did not receive support.
 
As a result, it is now officially neither the possession of Moscow nor Washington has the most prohibited weapons. But at the same time, land-based medium-range ballistic missiles in nuclear equipment are available in Israel, India, China, the DPRK and Pakistan. A few more countries have similar missiles in the usual equipment.

By the way, Bolton, in a conversation with the media, pointed to the anomaly of the agreement concerning the deployment of missiles at sea. “Now sea-based cruise missiles have a range that falls under the INF range. But since they are located on American ships in the Baltic Sea, they do not violate the treaty. And if you move them to the coast of Poland, it will already be a violation, ”he said.
 
The adviser to the American president also called the agreement "not meeting today's challenges," because, according to the US, Russia violated it, and China, Iran and North Korea "can do whatever they want." He also believes that it is impossible to make the contract universal or expand its membership.

Who stole a nuclear baton
Russia and the United States accuse each other of violating disarmament treaties
The question of the necessity or political significance of the treaty is actively discussed by experts and politicians. Someone thinks that in modern realities it can be sent to a landfill, and it’s time for Moscow to revive the grouping of medium-range ground-based missiles. Others point out that breaking the agreement will be much more dangerous: now the US allies are not only in Western Europe, but also in Eastern, because the missiles will reach Russia so quickly that she will not have time to respond.
 
Signing the contract, Gorbachev considers his collapse to be unacceptable. According to him, now "and so the matter has been delayed, the process of the elimination of nuclear weapons has stopped," but instead of continuing the initiated policy, they "throw up" such decisions.
 
Similarly, opinions differ in the United States: some are confident that it is time to build up weapons, others, such as Senator Rand Paul, criticize statements of withdrawal. “This will undo the decades of bilateral arms control established during the Reagan era. We should not do this. We must strive to eliminate any problems associated with this treaty and move forward, ”he said.

However, the real headache for Americans, most likely, will not be Russia, but China. Beijing has an arsenal of medium and short-range missiles and successfully uses them to control the surrounding areas. Such an arsenal allows him in the event of war to effectively isolate the region and, for example, invade Taiwan if the need arises. At the same time, China has never been bound by the INF Treaty - the production of such missiles in the Celestial Empire has been established, technologies have been run in, samples are being upgraded. Americans will have to catch up with Beijing, and whether they can - the big question.
 
Despite the many years of mutual accusations of Americans and Russians for violations of the DDRts, no real action has yet been taken to get out of the agreement. But now it can become a reality: Trump took the habit of making such statements into reality. Russia, for the time being, lurched, does not want to guess, and is waiting for official clarification. In the meantime, diplomacy is standing still, military technology is moving forward - and, quite possibly, we are waiting for a new arms race. What ended the previous - in the 80s of the XX century - we all remember. It remains to hope that the mistakes of the past will not be repeated.

It is in the interests of Russia not to help Iran bypass the US sanctions. This was stated by a source in the administration of US President Donald Trump, writes Financial Times.
 
According to a senior official, Iran can offer Moscow to sell its oil on the world market, which will allow Tehran to avoid the restrictions imposed by Washington. “I would not recommend Russia to do this,” the source said.
 
It is noted that the US is trying to convince other countries to reduce trade relations with Iran.
 
The fact that Russia is ready to help Iran bypass US sanctions was reported on October 15 by Israeli media. According to journalists, after the entry into force of the anti-Iranian sanctions, fuel will be supplied to refineries in Russia, and from there to final customers. Tehran at the same time will receive payment from Moscow.
 
It is assumed that deliveries from Iran will be carried out through the Caspian Sea. The scheme also plans to use European countries, according to the documents of the Israeli Foreign Ministry.
 
The new package of US sanctions against Iran will come into force in November. Restrictions will apply to oil exports, industry, trade and operations of the Central Bank of the country in dollars.

The amount of overdue debt of other states of Russia, according to calculations of the Accounts Chamber, for 2017 increased by 36 percent ($ 3.5 billion), RBC reports.
 
By early February 2018, overdue debt reached $ 13 billion. The Court of Accounts explained this by “non-payment by the debtor countries of the corresponding payments established by intergovernmental agreements”.
 
The program of bilateral government loans to Russia is classified, so what countries specifically do not pay loans is not disclosed. Part of the loans is issued in the framework of military-technical cooperation (for the purchase of Russian weapons).
 
As of January 1, 2018, the total debt of foreign countries of Russia was equal to 38.3 billion dollars.
 
It is known that in 2017, Venezuela has delayed Russia paying one billion dollars in a loan within the framework of military-technical cooperation. In November, the parties came to an agreement, and the country received a deferment until 2027. Also reported about Ukraine’s debt of three billion dollars, trying to collect debt in a London court.

China appealed to the World Trade Organization (WTO) with a request to create an arbitration group to consider a dispute with the United States on duties on steel and aluminum, reports TASS with reference to a statement by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce. Earlier, a similar initiative was made by Russia.
 
“US duties on steel and aluminum are protectionist measures and seriously violate the principles of multilateral trade. Many WTO members, including China, oppose them, ”the statement reads.

The creation of a special panel will help “preserve the credibility of the multilateral trading system” and protect the WTO rules, the Chinese authorities are sure.
 
Duties on imports of steel and aluminum in the amount of 25 and ten percent, respectively, were introduced by Washington in March as part of a trade war initiated by President Donald Trump. Restrictions apply to all countries, with the exception of Australia and Argentina, but China is most affected as the main supplier of metals to the United States.

In the near future, the European Union hopes to work out a mechanism for circumventing US anti-Iran sanctions, which will allow buying Iranian oil and conducting legal business with this country. This was told by EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini, quoted by TASS.

“We presented this idea at the UN General Assembly in New York. EU countries have decided to create this system and are now actively working on the practical aspects of this mechanism. I am confident that this work will continue successfully in the coming weeks, ”said Mogherini.
 
According to her, the mechanism should be completely legal and open. In the future, it will be able to join other countries, including Asian countries, which traditionally act as partners of Iran.
 
In August, the EU recognized the United States anti-Iran sanctions to be void and void on its territory, and also prohibited its government bodies and companies from sticking to them. The second part of the restrictions should take effect in November. It provides for a ban on the export of Iranian oil and dollar operations of the Central Bank of the country.

The American edition of The Wall Street Journal reported that trade and financial restrictions had a positive effect on the state of the Russian market. Translation of the article on Wednesday, October 17, published by RBC.
 
According to experts of the investment company Aberdeen Standard Investments, the Russian economy received an incentive for development as a result of the introduction of US sanctions against Iran and the subsequent growth of oil prices by 14 percent.
 
In addition, the reduction in the value of the ruble by almost 20 percent had a positive effect. It was in a situation of high prices for raw materials and a weak currency, Russia found itself in an economically advantageous position, they noted in the publication.
