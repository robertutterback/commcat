The IMF downgrades world growth due to the brake of the eurozone and the commercial war 
January 21, 2019 17:09 


January 21, 2019 17:09 
Compartir! 
The   International Monetary Fund   (IMF) lowered forecasts for global growth   on Monday to 3.5% in 2019 and 3.6% in 2020, two tenths and one tenth less than what was last last October. In these months it has been verified that "the global expansion has been weakened", indicates the report 'Global Economic Perspectives' presented by the managing director of the IMF,   Christine Lagarde, within the framework of the Forum of Davos (Switzerland). 


The entity highlights the slowdown in the euro zone and the impact of the trade war. But there is also a weakening in the growth of the   emerging economies, in China and the United Kingdom due to a disorderly Brexit, which raises a panorama of deceleration in a large part of the world."The risks are growing," Lagarde said in the presentation. With that in mind, I have called on governments to accelerate reforms before the next crisis arrives. 


According to the report, growth in advanced economies, especially the euro zone, has moderated "faster than anticipated", while emerging economies are held back by "the contractions in Argentina and Turkey, as well as the impact of commercial actions on China and other Asian economies ". 


In the case of the euro zone, it speaks of a "marked" slowdown and forecasts a growth of 1.6% this year, three tenths less than expected in October. Germany sees its estimates cut by six tenths, to 1.3% due to the industrial slowdown; Italy will grow four tenths less than anticipated three months ago, to 0.6%; and France, for the yellow vests, one tenth less, at 1.5%. 


To this is added the uncertainty for the Brexit, for which it is "imperative" to find a solution. "The negative effects of uncertainty on British investments are already evident," the IMF says. 


The one that comes out unscathed is Spain. The entity maintained the growth outlook for the Spanish economy unchanged at 2.2% for 2019 and 1.9% for 2020. Spain continues to lead growth among the four major economies of the euro zone. In any case, the IMF points out that the growth was 2.5% in 2018, one tenth less than the Government's forecast. 


In other corners of the planet, the Fund maintains the estimates for the two largest world economies unchanged, despite the commercial war. The United States will continue with strong growth this year of 2.5%, which will moderate to 1.8% in 2020 as the fiscal stimulus begins to thin out.China will grow 6.2% this year and next, within its "necessary adjustment process in financial regulation." 


"The top priority for countries is to quickly and cooperatively resolve their trade differences and political uncertainty, instead of raising more trade barriers and destabilizing a global economy that is already slowing down," said IMF chief economist Gita Gopinath. . 


In Latin America, the increase will be 2% in 2019 and 2.5%, in both cases two tenths less than what was calculated three months ago. The worsening of the forecasts in Mexico, the deepening of the Venezuelan crisis, and the contraction of Argentina hampered growth. 


For its part, Brazil, the other major Latin American economy, will continue its "gradual recovery" with an expansion of 2.5% this year, one tenth less than expected, and 2.2% next, one more than estimated in October.

Scandal of corruption: A crisis explodes in the Bolsonaro clan 
January 21, 2019 17:34 


January 21, 2019 17:34 
Compartir! 
The crisis exploded. The "Bolsogate" uncovered a month and a half ago with complaints about "atypical" money movements, according to the Ministry of Finance, in accounts linked to the son of Jair Bolsonaro, escalated in recent days to become a scandal with unpredictable consequences. 


Given the magnitude of the case, the president summoned his son, the state deputy of Rio de Janeiro Flavio Bolsonaro, to an emergency meeting of almost four hours on Saturday at the Palace of Alvorada. Then, noting the international repercussion of this alleged scheme of money laundering, the president suspended the press conference scheduled for this week at the Global Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on his first trip abroad after the inauguration of the first from January. 


The latest news released by TV Globo indicate that Flavio Bolsonaro, the largest of the five sons of the president, received 96 thousand reais (30 thousand dollars) between June and July of last year deposited in a banking agency of the Rio de Janeiro Legislature. 


The money was credited in deliveries of up to 2 thousand reais following the modus operandi of the sheaves that thus avoid that the authorities discover the origin of the silver, according to the specialists in the matter. 


The dubious operations of Bolsonaro son and his adviser Fabricio Queiroz raised the suspicions of the Public Ministry of Rio and Coaf, the financial control body of the Ministry of Finance. 


The adviser Fabricio Queiroz is a friend of Jair Bolsonaro since the 80s when both were active military. One of the transfers of former military officer and former police Queiroz went to first lady Michelle Bolsonaro. 


With the passing of days the pieces began to emerge that show that the Bolsonaro clan - father, children and wife - maintains a broad link with the Queiroz clan, whose daughters and wife were also employees of the presidential family. 


Before inquiring about the doubtful deposits for Flavio Bolsonaro it had been informed that his adviser Queiroz made bank movements for 1.2 million reais (almost 400 thousand dollars) an amount much higher than his salary. 


And yesterday the O Globo newspaper contributed more gasoline to the highly flammable news agenda: it reported that the adviser Queiroz operated suspiciously another 5 million reais. 


How this crisis will be solved nobody knows. Having touched the core of the Bolsonaro clan - which acts as an autonomous political group - the episode threatens to erode the power of an unlikely president who arrived at the Planalto after forming a circumstantial alliance in the course of   an atypical election campaign. Of low democratic quality. 


The October elections will be remembered for the millions of messages on social networks with fake news fired against candidate Fernando Haddad, PT - an illegality that justice did not properly investigate - and the stabbing suffered in a proselytizing act thanks to which the right-wing candidate increased his popularity vertically in the first round and became unattainable in ballottage. 


All in all, the retired Army captain never had a blank check of the permanent power factors. 


The Armed Forces, the media, a good part of the Judicial Power and the market marched together with the candidate of the Liberal Social Party because it was they who guaranteed the triumph over the PT after the banning of Lula, who when announcing his desistance to compete for the presidential was the favorite with   40 percent of voting intentions. 


Finally Bolsonaro won easily: he obtained 57.7 million votes, minus 40 percent of the electoral roll and 55 percent of valid votes, which exclude whites and voids. He obtained 10 million votes of advantage over Haddad, but this election data did not make him an incontestable leader. 


The story about the "Bolsogate" began to grow since the beginning of December when the then president-elect spoke of his former relationship with Fabricio Queiroz and said that his friend deposited money in his wife's account to repay a loan. 


The revelations of the last days indicate that the version is unsustainable. And that the retired policeman Queiroz and the deputy Flavio Bolsonaro, elected federal senator, may be at the center of a criminal scheme. 


As the affair grew, the vice president, retired General Hamilton Mourao, began to make statements taking distance from the presidential clan. Mourao, who assumes the presidency this week while Bolsonaro participates in the Davos Forum, is a sort of unofficial spokesman for the Armed Forces which is, in fact, the main support of the government. In Brasilia it is said that the generals are not willing to immolate themselves with the retired captain if the fire devoured the Planalto Palace. 


Information about the "Bolsogate" published in recent days   by the Globo group possibly already knew each other before the elections. 


The fact that justice and multimedia have not aired them points to the alignment with Bolsonaro's candidacy. 


If this case had been known during the campaign, it could have affected the anti-corruption image of the winning candidate. 


What explains that change of Globo editorial direction ?. The group is repeating the modus operandi already observed in 1992 when it turned against the then president Fernando Collor de Mello who had to resign that year besieged by allegations of corruption. 


The same chain had been an ally of Collor in the 1989 campaign when the right-wing candidate defeated Lula in ballottage. 


Now the most powerful conglomerate in Latin America decided to attack Bolsonaro who, enthralled by the alliance between Donald Trump and the conservative TV Fox, showed his intention to choose as an ally to the Record group, linked to the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God. 


And not only that: last week the president received in his office the representatives of the Brazilian franchise of the American CNN, which will be directed by a journalist linked to Record. The landing of CNN has given rise to a sea of ??speculation, among them that the US corporation would be Bolsonaro's partner in its dispute against Globo.

IEA: The US could pump more crude than Saudi Arabia 
US production will expand by 1.1 million b / d this year 










The Universal newspaper 
01/21/2019 05:30 am 
Caracas.-The trip of the United States to the pre-eminence in the world oil trade is about to reach another milestone. Driven by the shale boom, the United States is already producing more crude than Russia or Saudi Arabia, which until recently competed for first place. 


By mid-year the United States will fare better. At this time, Saudi Arabia could increase production to its maximum capacity of 12 million b / d, surpassing the 11.8 million b / d produced by the United States in December, according to the International Energy Agency. 


Soon, even that will not be enough. US crude oil production is set to expand by 1.1 million barrels per day this year, according to the IEA, which considers that the United States will surpass Saudi Arabia's maximum level in the next six months. 


"By mid-year, US crude production will probably be greater than the capacity of Saudi Arabia or Russia," the Paris-based agency said in a report published on Friday, Bloomberg said. 


However, this additional magnitude will probably not translate into greater influence on prices. As only the Saudis remain willing to retain their production capacity when there is too much oil in the market, the kingdom will maintain its unique position as the so-called variable producer. 


The Agency maintained its forecast on the growth of global oil demand in 2019 to 1.4 million barrels per day (mb / d), according to its January report. "Our estimates of the rise in global oil demand in 2018 and 2019 remain at the level of 1.3 mb / d and 1.4 mb / d respectively," says the document published on the agency's website, Sputnik reported. 


In this way, the demand for oil in the world will reach 100.7 million barrels per day this year. In addition, the agency increased the forecast on the supply growth of non-OPEC countries in 2019 by 0.1 mb / d to 1.6 mb / d, so the cumulative supply in the oil market is expected of all the States that are not part of the Organization, it reaches up to 62.1 mb / d. 


Last December, OPEC agreed to cut the hydrocarbon pumping by 800,000 barrels per day for six months from January.

Save the planet and eat healthy: You have to reduce 50% of the red meat and sugar 
January 17, 2019 15:58 


January 17, 2019 15:58 
Compartir! 
Of recent form, an article replicated by multiple means in Spain assured in its holder: 'To stop eating meat is not going to save the planet'. Well, a new report by the prestigious medical journal The Lancet, which has involved the participation of 37 scientists from various disciplines, you have concluded that for human health and that of the planet a radical change of our diet is needed that reduces more than 50% of red meat and sugar. 


This work carried out for 3 years by the EAT-Lancet commission specifically assesses how to achieve feeding 10 billion people in 2050 with   a diet of 'planetary health', a concept that refers to "the health of human civilization and the state of the natural systems on which it depends". The report is of great interest, since it tries to establish for the first time   quantitative scientific objectives that allow to act on a large scale to transform the world alimentary system. 


Scientists believe that the data are strong enough to affirm that if we want to feed all of humanity in a healthy way, without degrading natural ecosystems, an immediate action is required. This entails in the first place a change to healthy diets that double the consumption of fruits, vegetables, legumes and nuts, and reduce to more than half the added sugars and red meat (mainly, reducing their excessive intake in the richest countries). ). 


The report does not defend vegetarianism, but a 'flexitarian' diet: based mainly on foods of vegetable origin, but which can occasionally include modest amounts of fish, meat and dairy products. According to the Lancet report, these modifications of eating habits could prevent about 11 million deaths per year in the world, representing between 19% and 24% of total adult deaths. 


A plate of planetary health: half of the volume should be fruits and vegetables, the other half should mainly contain whole grains, vegetable proteins, unsaturated vegetable oils and (optionally) modest amounts of preoteins of vegetable origin. A planetary health dish: the half of the volume should be fruits and vegetables, the other half should mainly contain whole grains, vegetable proteins, unsaturated vegetable oils and (optionally) modest amounts of animal protein. LANCET 
"The food we eat and how we produce it determines the health of people and the planet, and today we are doing it really badly," says Tim Lang, a professor at the University of London and one of the members of the commission that has made the study. "We need to review this in a serious way, to change the global food system on a scale never seen before in a form adapted to the circumstances of each country." 


In addition to these dietary changes, the report also considers a combination of other strategies necessary, including a drastic reduction in food waste and significant improvements in food production practices. 


Regarding the conservation of biodiversity, The Lancet's work proposes the adoption of a 'Middle Earth' strategy, which means conserving at least 80% of the wealth of pre-industrial species and protecting the remaining 50% of the Earth as ecosystems without touching. This also means better management of the oceans worldwide, to ensure that the fishing industry does not have a negative impact on ecosystems and that aquaculture expands in a sustainable manner. 


"World food production threatens the climatic stability and the resilience of the ecosystem. It is the biggest driver of environmental degradation and transgression of planetary limits, "says Johan Rockström, researcher at the Stockholm Resilience Center. "A radical transformation of the global food system is urgently needed."

FITUR will celebrate its edition 39 
At the end of January, the International Tourism Fair will begin its edition this year

Start NEWS INTERNATIONAL The Pope wants the bishops to have clear rules against ... The Pope wants the bishops to be very clear about the rules against abuse By EFE - January 16, 2019 11:16 am ( Courtesy) Pope Francis wants that after the unprecedented meeting in February on the protection of minors, the bishops will return with "absolutely clear what needs to be done to prevent and combat the global drama of abuse."    












Interim spokesman of the Vatican, Alessandro Gisotti, called on the media today to offer a statement with some details about the objectives of the meeting to which the presidents of the episcopal conferences from around the world have been summoned from February 21 to 24. 




For the Pope, "it is fundamental that returning to their countries, in their dioceses, the bishops gathered in Rome are aware of the rules to apply and thus fulfill the necessary steps to prevent abuses, to protect the victims, not to allow no case is hidden or concealed, "said Gisotti. 


He pointed out that "Pope Francis knows that a global problem can only be faced with a global response. And he wants the meeting to be a meeting of pastors, not a study convention. A meeting of prayer and discernment, catechetical and operative. " 


When referring to what he considered "the great expectations that have been created around the meeting", Gisotti wanted to point out in his statement that "the Catholic Church is not at the starting point in the fight against abuses" because "the meeting is the stage of a painful path but without pause that, with decision, the Church has been traveling for more than fifteen years ". On the other hand, the Vatican announced that the exporter of the press office Federico Lombardi will be the moderator of the plenary sessions to be held.










In the unprecedented meeting, since in the history of the Church this type of convocation had never been done but in the Councils, in addition to the representatives of the 130 Episcopal Conferences, victims of abuses by the clergy will also participate. 


Also present will be heads of the Eastern Catholic Churches, those responsible for the different dicasteries and representatives of the Unions of Superiors General, both female and male, and members of the Commission for the Protection of Minors, among others. 


All of them will participate in plenary sessions, work groups and common prayer and listen to testimonies. 


The Argentine pontiff will participate in all the sessions of this meeting. 


On Saturday the 23rd a penitential liturgy will be celebrated and on Sunday the 24th a closing mass of the meeting will be held. 


Francisco met today to learn how the preparation is being developed for the organizing committee, composed of the archbishops of Chicago (USA), Blase J. Cupich; and of Bombay, Cardinal Oswald Gracias - two figures that have been characterized by their battle against abuses-; the recently appointed deputy secretary of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the Maltese Charles Scicluna, and the president of the Center for the Protection of Minors of the Pontifical Gregorian University and member of the Commission for the Guardianship of Minors, Hans Zollner.


Last month, the organizing committee of the meeting asked the presidents of the episcopal conferences to prepare this meeting with visits to the victims of their respective countries.

2019: Data protection and security as a premise 
Posted by: LaRed in Ciberculto, News January 16, 2019                  0   1,404 Views 


According to the report "Trends 2019: Privacy and intrusion in the global village" presented by ESET, the topics of cybersecurity that will be highlighted in the current year will have its focus on data protection and privacy, highlighting the role of virtual currencies , machine learning and connected smart devices. 


"Cyber ??attacks, data leaks and cases in which failures were reported in the control of the privacy of customers and users during 2018, make clear the challenge of ensuring the protection of assets. on safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity and availability of computer systems and data, "said Camilo Gutiérrez, Head of the Research Laboratory of ESET Latin America. 


The report reflects on the importance and responsibility of companies when it comes to protecting the large volumes of data they have collected over the years. 2018 was highlighted in the history of data privacy, because the European Union (EU) made effective the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which has implications for any organization (regardless of its location) that handles personal information of EU citizens. According to the ESET report, other parts of the world will take the path of the EU, and also analyze the possibility of the existence of a global law. 


In terms of malware, the report highlights that used for illegal cryptocurrency mining by 2019. Although it was not the main topic of 2018, the illegal mining of cryptocurrencies had a growth in terms of propagation (among which the practice is known as cryptojacking stands out), which will surely occupy a prominent place in the scenario of threats for next year. 


On the other hand, the role of smart homes is highlighted through the use of voice assistants. The existing possibilities that criminals can take advantage of IoT devices interconnected in the home and thus invade privacy, in addition to highlighting the role of users linked to the amount and type of data that is shared with these devices. 


In this context, the report has a section devoted to Machine Learning (ML). This technology, which is based on the generation of information from the automated analysis of large volumes of data, also gained space in the field of cybersecurity. Although the algorithms used could allow developers to identify current threats in a more efficient way, they can also be used by malicious actors to develop automated tasks and obtain information on vulnerable targets. The ESET report explains the potential of this technology for both attackers and those in charge of security.

Why does Bolsonaro want (ba) a US military base in Brazil? 
January 14, 2019 9:50 


January 14, 2019 9:50 
Share! 
Bolsonaro, an ex-captain of a minor rank, detracted in a humiliating manner from his idea of ??granting a military base to the US, rejected by the Brazilian generals. 


Perhaps I have ignored the work of the Russian military analyst Andrei Martyanov and the chess movements on a global scale of the new panoply of Russian supersonic weapons such as the Avangard and its hypothetical deployment in the South Pole. 


In an interview with SBT television, the newly anointed President Bolsonaro said he wanted to allow a US military base in Brazil to counter Russian influence in Venezuela. 


There is no doubt in Bolsonaro's confessed admiration - used of "Trump tropical" -, by his American counterpart, or the fascination of two of his children by the Mossad (Hebrew secret services) and by the Israeli Army or the brotherhood of the Israeli troubled Prime Minister Netanyahu with the Brazilian president through the glue of "Zionist evangelism." 


Rodrigo Viga, of the British agency Reuters, reported that the "military of Brazil is uneasy with the opening of Bolsonaro to a US military base." 






Russian military analyst Andrei Martyanov comments in his seminal book "The loss of military supremacy: the short-sightedness of US strategic planning" that "in the end, being attacked from the south pole, across South America, is not a contingency that The US military is capable of confronting. "This was the reason why President Bolsonaro invited Trump to install his military base in Brazil. 


It should be noted that Martyanov had advanced the supersonic prowess of the Avangard missile that has just been successfully tested at a speed of 30,000 km / h and with a multivariable trajectory that pierces any enemy defense anywhere in the world. 


By the way, it is widely known that one of the strategic vulnerabilities of the US is the Caribbean, defined as its "soft-belly"or soft belly. 


The generals of Brazil, of a higher rank than the ex-captain Bolsonaro, must be very much in sync with this ominous scenario - the mixture of the Caribbean and the South Pole with the Avangard - which is why they may have rebelled against the unilateral decision of the brand new Brazilian President, who apparently does not know the great geostrategic moves. 


It is not the first time that the military of high rank of the Brazilian Army, in particular, of its vice president, the retired general Hamilton Mourao, inhibit Bolsonaro. 


Mourao had already diluted Bolsonaro's warlike wine and recommended greater "caution with China, Mercosur and Israel." 


The retired military officer said that a good relationship with China is vital for Brazil and "can not be neglected," and then predict a coup in Venezuela. 


The promotion of the coup d'état and / or assassination of President Maduro is not new. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Riabkov himself warned the US against a military invasion of the Caribbean country. 


Maduro is aware that John Bolton, Trump's National Security Advisor, directs the plan to overthrow him with the help of mercenaries from Colombia and the US. 


Nor is it coincidence that it was a British agency that stopped the Bolsonaro impetus by the old trick of citing clandestinely to its source: "an officer who spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to discuss the matter publicly". This ethereal "source" ruled that "the Brazilian Army would be against a US military base," a possibility that "took the officers by surprise" as they are considered "traditional guardians jealous of national sovereignty." 


The Ministry of Defense of Brazil, through its spokesman, declared that "the President did not discuss" the issue of the military base with them, while the acrobatic chancellor Ernesto Araújo, during the meeting of the Lima Group of 13 countries that monitor the behavior of others under the aegis of Trump, in this case of Venezuela - whose Presidency tried to delegitimize (with the exception of Mexico) - confirmed Bolsonaro's desire to allow the opening of a US military base in Brazil. 






It should be noted that the visit to Venezuela in December of the Russian "white swans" - two strategic bombers with nuclear capacity that flew almost 10 hours and 12,000 kilometers - exasperated Mike Pompeo, secretary of defense and former director of the CIA. 


The Russian "white swans" returned home five days after their exercises with the Venezuelan Air Force. 


The message is pristine: in only 10 hours could the Russian "white swans" return to the Caribbean in the event of a US-sponsored invasion. 


According to the Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper, "Bolsonaro withdraws from the US military base in Brazil" and sent the message to the generals of the Army leadership who spoke against his proposal. The message was transmitted by the defense minister, General Fernando Azevedo e Silva, who commented that "there was no reason (sic) for the base." 


The issue of the military base in Brazil has exposed the fractures within the cabinet of Bolsonaro (made up of seven soldiers), to such a degree that Augusto Heleno, National Security Adviser, dared to spread that "Bolsonaro has not offered to grant a military base to the US or receive US soldiers on Brazilian soil, "when the Brazilian president referred to the" Russian base in Venezuela ", which" suddenly brought (sic) to the base of the US base "... comments! 


The idea of ??the military base granted to the United States was celebrated by Mike Pompeo, head of the Pentagon, and the diffusion of the retraction of Bolsonaro by Voice of America draws attention. 


Why did the two Anglo-Saxon propaganda spokespersons, Reuters and VOA, take a lot of flight to the rejection of the Brazilian military leadership to the cession of Brazilian sovereignty by President Bolsonaro and his foreign minister Araujo? 


In the middle of World War II, the icon of Brazilian nationalism, Getúlio Vargas, "The Father of the Poor", authorized the installation of a military air base in Natal, the closest and most outgoing point of Brazil with Africa. At the end of the war, Getúlio Vargas, who lasted 18 years in power, asked his counterpart Franklin Roosevelt to withdraw from the US Air Force. 


The warlike frivolity of the ex-captain and today President Bolsonaro is not shared by the restraint and seriousness of the Brazilian Military High Command composed of generals of greater hierarchy and, above all, those who do not want Brazil to become a battlefield between the two highest powers. The world's nuclear weapons: the US, which has 800 military bases in the world, of which 76 are in Latin America-among the best known: 12 in Panama, 12 in Puerto Rico, 9 in Colombia and 8 in Peru, and Russia, which plans to open a military base in La Orchila, an island in Venezuela, with the horizon of a hypothetical piercing of the US defenses from the south pole with its supersonic panoply. 


If the US entered into a fury with the conventional Russian "white swans", how will it react to the flight of a Russian supersonic Avangard from the South Pole or from Venezuela, in case it manages to overcome the attacks of the Lima Group, which would make futile the hypothetical US air base in Brazil?

Scientific community: Ocean warming broke record in 2018 
January 13, 2019 16:11 


January 13, 2019 16:11 
Share! 
A group of US researchers and China have found that the ocean heat more than had been calculated, breaking last year to record in this respect, which damages marine life, reports the scientific journal Science. 


The scientific team, which used an international network of 3,900 floats deployed since 2000 by different oceans, found that the ocean temperature in 2018 was the highest since 1971, which contradicts the latest estimate offered by the United Nations in 2013, which calculated slower heat absorption rates. 


"Oceanic heat observation records show that warming is accelerating," reads the publication. "Global warming is here and there are important consequences." There is no doubt! ", Reads a statement from this scientific group quoted by Reuters. 


According to Lijing Cheng, a member of the Institute of Atmospheric Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and lead author of the article, "2018 was the warmest recorded year for the global ocean, surpassing 2017." 


Also, Lijing explained to the British agency that the temperature to a depth of 2,000 meters increased around 0.1 degrees centigrade between 1971 and 2010, specifying that the records on ocean warming have been increasing almost every year since the beginning of this century. 


The agency also mentions another study, published by the Copernicus European Union Climate Change Service, according to which last year it was the fourth warmest in terms of global surface temperatures since records were taken. 


The scientific community warns that the emissions of greenhouse gases caused by humans are heating the atmosphere and much of that heat is absorbed by the oceans. This situation is forcing fish to migrate to less warm waters. To this is added the negative impact that this has on coral reefs, as well as at sea level, which increases due to melting.

POLITICS Advertising space United States and China do not clarify next steps in business dialogue Neither side indicated what will be the next step in the 90-day truce in a tariff war that threatens to slow global economic growth AFP 10/01/2019 11:00 am Beijing.- The United States said that the Beijing talks for the end of the trade war between the two countries focused on the Chinese promise to buy more American goods.
































Washington offered no indication of progress in resolving the conflict triggered by China's technological ambitions and other thorny issues. The Ministry of Commerce of China said on Thursday that the two sides "will maintain close contact," said AFP. 


Neither side indicated the next step in the 90-day truce in a tariff war that threatens to slow global economic growth. 


This uncertainty had an impact on the Asian stock markets on Thursday: the Hong Kong Hang Seng index lost 0.5% while the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo fell 1.4%. 


The markets rose on the eve after the US president, Donald Trump, stoked optimism about possible advances with a tweet in which he said the talks were "on track." 


The US Trade Representative (USTR), who heads the US delegation, explained that the negotiators focused on China's promise to buy a "substantial amount" of agricultural, energy and manufactured goods, in addition to other products and services. 


The USTR statement emphasized Washington's insistence on "structural changes" in Chinese technology policy, access to its market, the protection of foreign patents and copyrights and the cyber-crook of trade secrets. He did not report any signs of progress in those fields. 


Trump raised the tariffs to 250,000 million of Chinese imports before the complaint that Beijing steals or pressures companies to deliver their technology. 


Washington also wants changes in several areas, including the initiatives of the ruling Communist Party for the creation of state-owned enterprises in robotics, artificial intelligence and other industries. 


US officials fear that these plans may erode the industrial dominance of their country, but Chinese leaders see them as a path to prosperity and global influence and are reluctant to abandon them. 


The two sides may be moving toward a "limited agreement," but the "United States commercial hawks" want to "limit the scope of that agreement and keep pressure on Beijing," said Michael Hirson, Jeffrey Wright and Paul Triolo, Eurasia Group in a report. 


"The risk that conversations are broken is still significant," they wrote. Beijing has tried to raise pressure from Washington and other trading partners on its industrial policy by pledging to increase its imports and open its industries to foreign competitors. 


Trump repeatedly complained about the trade deficit with China, which is likely to exceed $ 336 billion in 2017 last year. 


Experts say that the 90-day deadline is too short to solve all the conflicts between the two largest economies in the world.

Ransonware in Latin America: Most affected countries 
Published by: LaRed in E-soft, News January 10, 2019                0   2,647 Views 


ESET, a leading company in the proactive detection of threats, reports that the countries of the region ended the year with the most detections of malware of the ransonware type were Colombia (30%), Peru (16%) and Mexico ( 14%). While, globally, the United States (9%) and Russia (7%) took the first places in the ranking. 


The most active ransomware families in the world were TeslaCrypt, Crysis and CryptoWall, followed by TorrentLocker and WannaCryptor. However, some of these families are impacted in particular way in Latin America. 


Colombia was the country with the most detections of the ransomware called "Crysis" mainly because of a campaign directed especially for the country. The campaign used social engineering to trick users through an alleged email that informed them of a debt situation. In this way, the user downloaded the attached file from the fake email and became infected. 82% of ransomware detections in the country corresponds to Crysis. In total, 199% increase in detected in the country with respect to ransomware detections during 2017. 


Peru also has its own ransomware microecosystem dominated particularly by two families. One of them is CryptProjectXXX. This variant, in addition to encrypting information, has capabilities to steal sensitive information. 


The other ransomware family present in the country is Filecoder.NHN, created in 2016 and programmed with Autolt language. This language had an increase of 810% in detections since its appearance in 2015. 


In the case of Mexico, the ransomware scenario was found a little more diversified. Over the past year, more than 200 variants of ransomware have spread throughout Mexico. The two families that centralized the largest detections were Crysis and TeslaCrypt, each one concentrating 14% of the FileCoder detections in the country. CryptoWall with 13% got the third place. 


Finally, it should be mentioned that while ransomware has ceased to be the main focus of attention in the world of cybersecurity in terms of the amount of the devastating consequences region, according to ESET Security Report prepared by ESET Latin America. 


"As seen throughout 2018, and especially with the massive appearance of the cryptominers, we believe that cybercriminals could modify their modus operandi, focusing on the creation of more complex ransomware for corporate environments with much more propagation campaigns. of digital hijacking by adding new features. In any case, we can expect both to continue in force in the next few years, and not one that displaces or replaces the other, "reflects Camilo Gutierrez, Head of Laboratory at ESET Latin America.

Warming of the seas multiplies by 1000 energy

A multidisciplinary team of scientists estimates, in a study published Monday in PNAS, that there has been a global warming of the oceans of 436 x 1021 joules since 1871 to the present, approximately 1000 times the world's primary energy worldwide. 


The estimates support the evidence that the oceans are absorbing most of the excess energy in the climate system that arises from the greenhouse gases emitted by human activities. 


The technique to reconstruct the warming of the ocean is based on a mathematical approach developed by Professor Samar Khatiwala (Earth Sciences) to reconstruct the uptake of man-made CO2 by the ocean.

The Government of Brazil withdrew from the Global Compact for Migration established by the United Nations (UN), after having signed it last December. 


Local media have reported that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a communication to the Secretary General of the UN, António Guterres, and to the Director General of the International Organization of Migration (OIM), António Manuel de Carvalho Ferreira Vitorino, to notify the departure of Brazil of the covenant. 


According to the document, they explain that Brazil "should not participate in any activity related to the agreement or its implementation." 


For his part, President Jair Bolsonaro has described this pact as an instrument that "undermines the sovereignty of Brazil" and is "inadequate to deal with the migratory problem." 


The Global Compact for Secure, Ordered and Regular Migration was signed by the UN General Assembly and some 152 member countries, including Brazil, signed it. 


However, Bolsonaro has challenged on several occasions the global pacts like this and the Paris Agreement against global warming, which has also threatened to get out.

POLITICS Advertising space Bolsonaro says "No" to the migratory pact after reports that Brazil left the agreement After it was reported by the local press, a diplomatic source confirmed the abandonment of the treaty, although the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet officially declared AFP 09/01/2019 10:03 am Rio de Janeiro.- Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro criticized the Global Migration Pact on Wednesday after reports that Brazil abandoned the agreement, just as the new right-wing ruling party had promised before assuming power.
































"Brazil is sovereign to decide whether or not to accept migrants, who by chance comes here must be subject to our laws, rules and customs, as well as sing our anthem and respect our culture," Bolsonaro tweeted, AFP quoted. 


"Not everyone enters our house, nor will anyone enter Brazil through a pact adopted by third parties, NOT THE MIGRATORY PACT," he added. And he praised: "We will never deny aid to those who need it, but immigration can not be indiscriminate, criteria are necessary." 


After it was reported by the local press, a diplomatic source confirmed that Brazil abandoned the UN pact, although the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet officially ruled. 


From the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in Brazil, one source stated that they had not been formally notified. 


The pact, the first worldwide to manage migration, raises 23 objectives to discourage illegal migration, at a time when the flow of migrants has increased to almost 260 million in the world, 3.4% of the global population. 


The document, agreed among 165 countries at the beginning of December in Morocco, was ratified with 152 votes in favor, 5 against (the United States, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Poland and Israel) and 12 abstentions, including Chile. Brazil voted in favor, even under the conservative government of Michel Temer, although the team of the president-elect at the end of October had already spoken out against it. 


Bolsonaro took office on January 1. His chancellor, Ernesto Araújo, had criticized the document on December 10, stating that it was an "inadequate instrument." 


"Immigration should not be treated as a global issue, but in accordance with the reality and sovereignty of each country," he tweeted. Brazil faces a migratory crisis in the state of Roraima, bordering Venezuela, which has seen a large increase in the flow of Venezuelans fleeing the crisis in their country. 


Despite the great impact that the entry of Venezuelans has had on that Brazilian state, immigrants constitute less than 1% of the total population of Brazil, currently estimated at 209 million inhabitants, according to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). 


"By announcing the end of the pact, the government of Bolsonaro adopts an antiquated and wrong grammar of considering the immigrant as a threat to national sovereignty," says Camila Asano, coordinator of the Foreign Policy Area of ??the NGO Conectas. 


Thus, Brazil is "undermining one of its main international credentials": a migration policy "seen as a reference," I added. 


Asano considers it crucial that the new government continue to offer welcome to Venezuelan migrants, without "extreme measures such as the creation of possible refugee camps," as Bolsonaro suggested late last year.

Chinese Communist Party will punish whoever believes in spirits and not in Marxism By EFE - January 7, 2019 9:16 am (EFE) The Communist Party of China (CPC) branch in the southeastern city of Xiamen promised to punish its members who "believe in spirits and supernatural beings instead of Marxism- Leninism, "the official newspaper, the Global Times, reports today.




    


















    












In fact, the CCP's local disciplinary commission has carried out checks to discover if any of its 70,000 members have participated in "superstitious activities". 




Those who have presented "problems" in the eyes of the Party must rectify by means of a "self-inspection" that affects participation in "religious organizations, sects or supersitious groups", as well as "attendance at religious ceremonies or the use of visionaries". 


These norms were published last August, and so far the local authorities have discovered a score of cases in which officials have violated the political discipline of the Party. 


According to an anonymous source of the Office of Ethnic and Religious Affairs of Xiamen quoted by the Global Times, all the members of the CCP in this town recited the oath of the organization, had to sign a letter of commitment to atheism and Marxism, and They promised to follow the rules and faith of the Party. 


In 2018, the CPC of Xiamen organized 31 courses on discipline in which more than 2,600 militants participated. 


The official newspaper reminds that, according to the latest CCP disciplinary rules - published in 2018 by its Central Committee - affiliates who believe in religions "must be educated" and must be asked to withdraw from the Party if "education fails correct them.

Waters of the Pacific 'ignores' global warming and goes against the current climate change 
January 6, 2019 13:43

The "long memory of the ocean" remembers the times when the Earth did not experience any warming, but the other way around, it was cooling, reveals an oceanographic study published this January 4 in the journal Science. Moreover, certain layers of water live that climate change that began on the surface about 700 years ago. 


Two authors estimated in particular that the waters of the Pacific between 2,000 and 4,000 meters deep are still being adjusted to the Little Ice Age, which arrived after the medieval warm period (900-1300 AD). The effects of the warming that we lived (which began in the mid-nineteenth century) are focused even closer to the surface, although it is not the case of the Atlantic Ocean. 


To obtain this information, the Americans Geoffrey Gebbie and Peter Huybers compared the data of an oceanographic expedition of the 1970s (of the British corvette Challenger) with the most modern available. They also applied to computerized model of the ocean to imitate the patterns of water circulation in the contemporaneity. 


It is a "disturbing echo of temperatures from a time in the past," Gebbie told Live Science. And understanding the ocean's ability to contain heat from above is important for those who study the climate. In his view, understanding climate change is first and foremost "studying where heat and carbon move around the Earth." 


In previous research the same scientists established that the deep waters of the Pacific are very "old". Thus, water that is 2,500 meters deep touched the surface about 1,000 years ago. That is why the lower layers continue to cool under the effects of a colder climate than today, which dominated the planet four, five or six centuries ago.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) held its Media Day at its headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland, where it presented the forecasts for this year. By 2019, the agency expects global aviation net profits to reach 35.5 billion dollars, the tenth consecutive year of profitability for the airline industry, which implies an increase in initial forecasts of 32.3 billion. 


"We expected high costs to weaken our profitability, but the significant fall in oil prices and the solid projections of growth of the Gross Domestic Product worked as a cushion," said Alexandre de Juniac, IATA's managing director.

The directions of politics in Our America 
January 5, 2019 13:44 


January 5, 2019 13:44 
Share! 
Mexico and Brazil have new governments and encourage the debate of the course of the region, with Cuba fulfilling 60 years of revolution against the capitalist order. Reformist, reactionary or revolutionary changes for the region? 


Venezuela and Nicaragua are at the center of the OAS offensive, that is, the US and the governments of the continent, which preach free trade, even against the protectionist discursive diatribe from Washington. 


Bolivia faces an election time where the change process inaugurated in 2006 is discussed. 


Right-wing governments and "pro-market" are entrenched in several of the countries in the region, including some of those who staged the reformist wave. 


Our America is convulsed and in debate, not only by its national and / or regional processes that involve the process of integration or disintegration, but by what happens in the world, especially with Donald Trump in the US Government and its "nationalist" policy "With rising interest rates. 


A US foreign policy that in imperial logic extends over the entire continent and therefore fears the presence of China, of increasing commercial, economic and financial weight in the region. 


The framework of the debates on the course takes place at a time of poor growth of the world economy, with a slowdown in 
regional economic evolution , affecting social economic rights won with historical struggles of the peoples. 


What is at stake is the daily life and satisfaction of the broad needs of society, and that is why we are interested in discussing where we are going in the construction of the economic and social order. 


As we pointed out at the beginning, we ask ourselves if this is a time of reforms as the new Mexican government assumes; against proposed reforms 
with the assumption of the Brazilian Government; or confirmation of perspectives that emanate from the 60 years of revolution in Cuba. 


Where is our America going? 




The turn of the century, from the XX to the XXI, stimulated the debate and new processes emerged discussing the conservative tradition for decades, especially the neoliberal consensus since the 80s of the last century. 


The novelty was the socialist horizon that extended the lonely anti-capitalist experience and the socialism expressed by Cuba from 1959-61. 


In the political language appeared the horizon of 21st century socialism in Venezuela, or community socialism in Bolivia; along with constitutional characterizations for Living Well or Good Living, in Bolivia and Ecuador, respectively. 


There were also income distribution proposals compatible with innovative integration processes, which included unfinished proposals for a new financial architecture, and even cooperation mechanisms for renewed productive and development projects in areas that await better opportunities for their realization, especially in food matters. or energetic 


Nuestramerica appeared as an identity that recovered an emancipatory perspective for more than 200 years and with the ability to interact with the ancestral tradition of indigenous peoples. 


That is why we highlight the experience that included the emergence of new subjects that made visible the complexity of the social, political and cultural struggle of our time. 


In this sense, the indigenous, indigenous and peasant movement with a long trajectory in the civilization confrontation stands out, especially in the 
Andean countries , expanding the territoriality of the indigenous struggle and constituting a visible phenomenon of a continental and global character since the process of political change. Bolivian since 2006. 


In that order arises to the social consideration, the struggle of women and the feminist movement in its diverse currents and meanings, with demands for gender equality and against all sexual discrimination. The movement acquired a cultural dimension that went through the whole society, creating a leap in the socialization of a claim that appeared from my own and particular to become social and general. 


In the same way, the environmental struggle and in defense of common goods becomes relevant, against the productive and development model that affects and depredates the nature and condition of life on the planet, and involves considerations about habitat, urbanization and the colonization and subordination to capitalism and the consumerism of everyday life, in the countryside and the city. 


The complexity of the social, political, economic and cultural struggle diversified the tradition of class confrontation, of the contradiction between capital and labor, to acquire from there other and articulated dimensions that challenged the current order, composing a new singularity to the social conflict and the class struggle. 


Looking at the current panorama, the revolution continues to be an eternal dream, paraphrasing Andrés Rivera, the writer who recovered expectations at the beginning of the 19th century, in Haiti or South America, and who we project in the processes lived in 1959 in Cuba, in 1979 in Nicaragua, and with nuances and specificities in recent times throughout the continent . 


A dream that merges with diverse expectations for social reforms, those that feed a debate of time on reform and revolution, and even against reform, and summons us to solve the question about the present and the future of the course in the Latin American region and Caribbean 


Is the struggle for equality under capitalism possible? 
Beyond revolution or revolutions, the 21st century generated expectations of income distribution and satisfaction of the needs of the most vulnerable sectors 
. 


From ECLAC, socio-economic indicators were based on an improvement in the distribution of income, but not necessarily on wealth. The illusion of the reform of capitalism gained space in politics and encourages new and renewed illusions to repeat the experience, beyond the reactionary actions of the hegemonic and dominant sectors. 


Massive social policy appeared on the scene and diminished the most harmful effects of the concentration of income and wealth. It was a massive social policy that transcended national processes of the "turn to the left" and that generalized beyond the right or left orientation of governments. 


Moreover, in the current offensive of the right, the massiveness of social policy does not diminish, but rather expands in the perspective of containing social conflict. 


Under these conditions of articulation of a perspective of reform and revolution, the times of revenge and against reform did not wait and the conservative and traditional political hegemony disputed the consensus of society. 


He did it with soft blows, supported by parliaments or judicial systems, or electorally by way of media manipulation. 


For this the traditional means of communication, monopolies, private or public, along with new emerging social networks, permeated by a religiosity and individualist ideology of "every man for himself", functional to the logic of capitalist domination, with axis in personal security 


The capitalist order thus seeks the normality of its operation, that is, of profit and accumulation, distancing reality from any revolutionary or reformist perspective. 


He no longer goes to the tradition of the military civic coup; but to new mechanisms based on the manipulation of social consensus, even falsifying 
reality. 


What we intend to discuss is the democratic and economic order underway and as a whole, which means analyzing the horizon of confrontation for 
equality, together with the freedom to choose and govern. 


It is not enough to fight for equality, the distribution of income and wealth, if at the same time the political and cultural order is not questioned under its really existing democratic forms, which implies overcoming the elective character of democracy in order to address mechanisms of role of the community in decision-making. 


In America there was a time when contradictions appeared between dictatorships or constitutional democracies, but now, behind the facade of constitutional governments that stabilize the capitalist order, it is necessary to discuss a comprehensive strategy of the economy and politics, of equality and freedom to resolve the demands of an impoverished and exploited majority. 


Economic and political rights for a future lie 
A horizon of discussion on the contents of emancipation is needed, at the same time as the forms of the political participation of society are debated. 


Food, energy or financial sovereignty demands sovereignty in the decision-making ways of daily life. The community needs to express the directions of the contents and ways to solve unmet needs. 


It is not just economy or politics, but economics and politics; productive and development model, of forms of coexistence of society in our time, in 
a search to overcome the conjunctural debate. That is why it is not enough with the discussion contained in electoral processes limited to the field of the possible that recreate previous moments of social construction. 


Strictly speaking, the changes come from new practices deployed in the movement of society, which can modify the collective consciousness and thus, from cultural hegemony, try to institutionalize new modalities in production, distribution, change and consumption, under modalities of protagonism and expanded participation in decision-making about the political, economic, social and cultural order. 


We intend to point out that there will be no distribution of income and less of the wealth or new economic order, if the policy is not modified simultaneously, that is, the exercise of the sovereignty of the people.

China announced to have achieved for the first time in history the successful landing of a probe on the hidden side of the Moon, according to the National Space Administration of China (ANEC). The agency, quoted by the official Xinhua news agency, said the milestone starring the unmanned spacecraft Chang'e-4 took place on Thursday in the Aitken basin, at the south pole of the Earth satellite, at 10 am : 26 hour from China (02; 26 GMT) 


The official Chinese newspaper Global Times indicated that the achievement carried out by the unmanned ship Chang'e-4 took place in the Aitken basin, at the south pole of the Earth satellite. 


What is China looking for on the dark side of the Moon? 
The probe, which includes a module and an explorer, transports instruments to study the geology of the area, as well as seeds of potatoes and plants to grow on the Moon as a biological experiment. 


A few hours after its landing, the mission sent the first images taken from the surface of the satellite. 


In the absence of a direct communications link, all images and data are first sent to a separate satellite and then transmitted from there to Earth. 


A "great milestone" 
Although previous missions were directed towards the Moon's side facing Earth, this is the first time that a ship descends on the hidden side. 


The official newspaper Global Times called the achievement of Thursday as a "great milestone in the exploration of space." 


Space programs such as the Soviet or the US have already achieved more than half a century ago photographing the hidden face of the Moon but never landed there, although in 1962 a US unmanned mission tried unsuccessfully. 


In recent days, the ship Chang'e-4 had reduced its orbit in preparation for the landing. 


During the past weekend, Chinese state media claimed that the probe had entered an elliptical path around the moon, reaching position 15 km from the lunar surface at its closest point. 


The dark side The mission departed on December 8 from the Xichang satellite launch center in Sichuan province to learn more about the Aitken basin, a place of interest for being the oldest and largest impact area on the lunar surface . 


The hidden face of the Moon can never be seen from Earth due to a phenomenon known as "synchronous rotation", since our satellite takes as long to turn on its own axis as to complete an Earth orbit. 


For this reason, this face is also known as "dark side", although it is illuminated by the Sun and also experiences both day and night.  


The objective of the Chang'e-4 mission is to explore the Von Kármán crater located in the Aitken basin at the Moon's south pole, which is estimated to have been formed by the impact of a giant asteroid billions of dollars ago. years. 


It is believed that the person responsible for forming this basin was so powerful that it crossed the outer crust of the satellite and reached the lunar mantle. 


Scientists want to study any rock in the mantle that is exposed to this impact. 


The researchers also hope to study parts of the sheet of molten rock that would have filled the basin, allowing them to identify variations in their composition. 


Finally, a third objective is to study the regolith of the hidden side of the Moon: the rocks and dust that form the surface of the satellite. 


Cameras and experiments 
The Chang'e-4 lander carries two cameras with which low-frequency radio astronomy observations can be made. 


It also transports a 3 kg container with potato seeds and arabidopsis plants, as well as silkworm eggs for biological studies. 


The rover also has a panoramic camera, a radar to probe under the lunar surface, an image spectrometer to identify minerals and an experiment to examine the interaction of the solar wind with the lunar surface. 


The correspondent of the BBC in China, John Sudworth, believes that with this mission there was more at stake than just a scientific achievement. 


The journalist highlights the propaganda value of a step forward in his space career was driven by the careful management of state media, which published very little news of the landing before it was officially announced that it had been a success. 


China started relatively late in terms of space exploration. It was not until 2003 that I felt his first astronaut into orbit, becoming the third country after the Soviet Union and the United States. 


The Chang'e program (named in honor of a goddess who, according to Chinese legends, lives on the Moon) began with the launch of a first orbital probe in 2007, and since then four more devices have been launched to Earth's satellite. . 


The long-term objective of the program is a manned mission to the Moon, although no date has been set for it and some experts do not consider it possible before the year 2036.

And they would not have served to determine for sure who is better. The first fight ended in a draw in 2017. This year, in the second, a judge decreed a new parity between the opponents, but the other two gave the advantage to "Canelo" by 115-113. 


And in the middle of the night of September 15, while the country was celebrating Independence Day, Álvarez also unleashed the Mexican party in Las Vegas. 


He seized the title of the middlemen, dethroned one of the best fighters of this generation and washed his own image, after the positive result of clenbuterol released in March, which forced to postpone the fight originally scheduled for May 5. 


But he won by a minimum margin. Therefore, a new lawsuit can be seen in the horizon of 2019. "For me it ended in September," said Alvarez. 


"But it was two good fights." "Canelo" made the remarks just on December 16 at Madison Square Garden, immediately after knocking out Rocky Fielding in the third round, to strip him of the super middleweight title. 


Álvarez climbed from 160 to 169 and became the ninth Mexican boxer who has reigned in three different categories. "It means a lot to enter that select group of Mexicans," said Álvarez, 28. 


"It's what motivates me. It's a lot to be part of that list of Mexican elite fighters. m looking for, making history "... For now, he's also making money.

Brazil on the world stage (before investiture of Bolsonaro)

A review of the last presidential elections in Brazil and the corresponding political process deserves to careful and unprejudiced analytical effort of new political and social phenomena, of the reinvention of old strategies and, above all, of the ability of conservative forces to adapt to regional scale and global. 


After a cycle of 15 years of progressive, left or center-left governments, as the reader prefers, in Latin America there were important advances in some social, economic and political aspects of great relevance: 


1. Expansion of public spending on social policies that led to increased sectors of the population, significantly reducing the levels of poverty and poverty; increased investment in education by allowing access to the university system of a large number of young people, historically excluded from the higher education system; improvement of public health systems; affirmative policies aimed at blacks, indigenous and other demographic minorities; gender equality policies, etc. These social policies generated new consumers, but were not able to generate citizens aware of the process of social inclusion of those who were part. 


2. A new dynamic of regional integration based on the creation of new regional spaces such as the Union of South American Nations-Unasur (2008), the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States-Celac (2012), the Bolivarian Alliance for the ALBA-peoples and the deepening of the already existing processes, such as Mercosur, which ceased to be a space of strictly commercial integration to become a forum for scientific, technological, academic and, even, university cooperation. The University of Regional Integration-Unila, created by the government of President Lula in the triple border region, Foz do Iguaçu, is a paradigm of the density of this process. 


The integrationist vision, in this period, was not consensual among the governments of the region, but it was certainly hegemonic, so that it managed to drag even conservative governments, which despite not being architects of it, could not oppose the current generated for a vision of integration based, to a greater or lesser extent, on a principle of sovereignty over extraregional interests. 


Perhaps one of the highest moments of this dynamic was from 2012, when Unasur is proposed as the central axis, at the initiative of its then Secretary General Alí Rodríguez Araque, a continental strategy for the use of natural resources for the integral development of the countries of the bloc, which placed as priority the local, national and regional interests in front of the demands of the transnationals that operate in the natural resources sector and in front of the strategies of access and management of these resources by of the central economies and hegemonic powers. 


The very concept of development was put into discussion: in the end, what development we were talking about if, for example, the mining activity that responded to the growing world demand for raw materials was the main source of socio-environmental conflicts, environmental devastation and the expulsion of local populations that lived in regions of large reserves of strategic minerals, expanding the conditions of poverty and misery of the same. 


A strategy of using these resources in the proposal of Unasur meant the economic management of the same through industrialization policies and creation of regional value chains, environmental management to minimize the impact of extractive activity and of transformation, of technological sovereignty that could sustain strategic regional industrial processes and of the social management of natural resources through the creation of participation mechanisms in the decision making of the populations affected by extractive activities. 


This proposal was accompanied by the creation of some fundamental instruments such as a South American Geological Service, which was able to systematize the geoscientific data and inventories of natural resources produced by the geological services of each country, and then return them to public managers, academia and citizenship gives each of the countries. 


Obviously, this project was quickly seen as a threat to the interests of the transnationals operating in the mining and oil sector, which are generally the institutions that generate and maintain this information, including, in many cases, beyond the reach of the Member States. where they operate.   In addition, this project put at risk the centrality of the United States Geological Survey-USGS, which receives this information from the countries of the region and maintains the most complete and up-to-date database that exists worldwide in the area of ??non-mineral minerals. fossils 


3. The participation of the region, through Brazil, in the Brics that became one of the main forums for interstate coordination of five emerging powers: Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.   This increasingly dynamic coordination space, with a development bank whose capital exceeds 600 billion dollars (if we add the available capital of the Bank of Brics and the Asian Development Bank), is redefining the dynamics of the world economy from which emerge new geopolitical alignments where China and its project of the New Silk Road, in its acronym in English: OBOR, occupy a central role. 


Conservative rise 
In this context: What did the last elections in Brazil mean? What were the interests that were at stake in this process? How could retiring captain Jair Bolsonaro and his newly created Liberal Social Party come to the Presidency and be one of the biggest seats in the congress in just one election?   Process that cost other parties like PT or PSDB more than 20 years. To try to answer these questions we will enunciate some ideas, still incipient, that can help us to understand this unprecedented phenomenon in the history of Brazil. 


The first thing that is important to point out is that in a few months the candidacy of Jair Bolsonaro becomes a movement, Bolsonarismo. And that this movement becomes a mass movement, dragging with it an unprecedented position in number of deputies of the states, federal deputies and elected governors. The elections win a candidate who withdrew from the public debate from almost the official start of the electoral campaign (he only participated in the first debate among the candidates for the Presidency, which cost him the decrease of some percentage points in the voting preferences of the voters), whose program was deeply unknown to the population and whose historical speech as a deputy was deeply marked by an admiration for the military dictatorships in the region, the extermination policies,misogynistic, homophobic and incentivizing speeches of armed violence as an instrument of public and social control. 


It is true that Brazil became perhaps the world's largest laboratory of a highly technological psychosocial strategy, which through social networks managed to profoundly impact public opinion through the elaboration and dissemination of a true arsenal of false news, or fake news, as it has been commonly called. But it is also true that a large part of the Bolsonaro voters migrated from the PT and other left organizations, with an important popular base. The first thing that should perhaps be recognized is that the left parties abandoned their social base over the last 15 years and, what is more serious, their presence in the community and the concrete life of the people, which ultimately represents a fundamental differential with other political proposals.  


  The social policies of progressive governments created new consumers, the so-called "D" and "C" classes, but they had great difficulty in creating new citizens with political awareness of the process that affected their daily lives. 


This void was gradually filled by the most conservative sectors of the evangelical church, which already had an important caucus since the presidential elections of 2014 and which acted as a true political party on a national scale in the 2018 elections, in favor of the candidate Bolsonaro. They oriented the vote of their faithful and echoed the arsenal of fake news distributed by social networks.  


These sectors of the evangelical church recovered the sense of community in the daily life of the population of the large urban peripheries and the favelas, disputing the symbolic construction of meaning, based on deeply conservative values ??from the political, social and conception point of view of traditional family. Now they are proposing to the Brazilian congress the revision of contents of basic and university education, to remove disciplines from the social sciences and humanities and to demand the obligatory nature of dogmatic religious contents, placing at risk the conquest of secular education in Brazil. 


Natural resources in sight 
Another aspect that in our opinion marked the dynamics of the Brazilian political process was the important role that this country played during the PT governments in the dynamization and deepening of the regional integration processes, because when considering a sovereign and autonomous vision, it put at risk the interests of the central economies and transnational corporations that operate in the region. 


The contemporary world conjuncture continues deeply marked by a global dispute for strategic natural resources. Brazil represents the fifteenth world oil reserve , since the discovery of the reserves of the marine base or of the Pre-salt as it is called in Brazil, during the Government of President Lula.   However, if the estimated reserves of the Pre-salt are verified, Brazil could go from the fifteenth to the third place of participation in the world oil reserves, after Venezuela and Saudi Arabia, first and second world reserves respectively. 


In the Temer government, the mandatory participation of the Petrobras company in the extraction of oil from the Pre-salt, as well as the minimum participation of 30% of the business in case the lots were operated by private companies, was revoked.   Subsequently, the law of local technological content, which forced to produce part of the technological equipment of the sector in Brazil, was left without effect. With this, successive auctions of lots of these reserves began and Brazil, in little more than two years, went on to import more than 50% of the petroleum derivatives that it consumes. 80% of these imports come from the US, the country that has the largest investment in this sector.  


The US interest in the Brazilian Pre-salt reserves was corroborated by the global operations director of Exxon, the main US company that invests in the sector, when, on September 29, one day after the last auction of the Batch of Brazilian oil, declares that the reserves of the Pre-salt represent the most important investment of the company in the global business portfolio, by the profitability, the quality of the oil and the potential of the reserves. 


Today (16-12-2018), the Folha de São Paulo newspaper discloses the content of a document proposed by the diplomat Ernesto Araujo, Brazil's next foreign minister, entitled "For an external policy of the Brazilian people" where he suggests a realignment International of Brazil with the axis of populist right on the rise in the world: USA of Trump, Italy, and some countries of Eastern Europe such as Poland and Hungary. It also proposes a confrontation with the Brics and, particularly, with China. We have heretofore stated some elements for analysis that certainly need further development, which the extension of this article does not allow. However, it seems clear to us that what is at stake in the Brazilian political process is the control of strategic natural resources.  


  To the oil, the Amazon should be added, and not only the Brazilian one, but the continental Amazon, increasingly surrounded militarily; access to the main freshwater reserves and areas with a high concentration of biodiversity, as well as important primary energy sources. In addition, Brazil under the management of an ultraconservative government means the guarantee of the destructuring of regional integration and its different forums and, together with them, any vision of local, national or regional sovereignty. In addition, of course, the impact of Brazilian policy on the dynamics of regional policy as a whole. It is therefore an important piece in an ultraconservative strategy at the scale of the paneta.  


This global conservative strategy has, however, some stones in the shoe: the election of a progressive government in Mexico with AMLO, the growing Chinese presence in the main economic sectors and strategic infrastructure in the region, challenging the hegemonic interests of the US, as well as the significant erosion of the conservative governments in the continent, which have produced important economic dislocations in Latin America, as is the case of Macri's Argentina.

The Ministry of the Interior affirmed immediately after the attack that two tourists of Vietnamese nationality had died and added that another twelve people - ten Vietnamese tourists and the driver and a representative of an agency, both of Egyptian nationality -, had been wounded. 


The prime minister, Mustafa Madbuli, later confirmed that the representative of the tourist agency, who would be a guide, has died in the hospital because of the wounds suffered in the attack. Also, Sadek has indicated that another of the tourists has died hours after the event. 


The announcement came shortly after the prime minister paid a visit to the wounded in the hospital, after which he has held talks with the Interior Minister and the governor of Giza to address the situation, Europa Press reported. 


According to the information collected by the local newspaper 'Al Ahram', the bomb had been attached to a wall on Al Mariuteya Street. For the moment, no group has claimed responsibility for the attack. 


For its part, Sadek has ordered the opening of an investigation to determine the nature of the material used in the manufacture of the pump. 


Also, the recordings of the security cameras in the area will be seized. Madbuli has stressed that all tourist trips and routes have a security device in charge of the Ministry of the Interior and added that the bus deviated from the planned route without previously notifying the authorities. 


"I want to emphasize that, after the incident, all state agencies mobilized quickly to ensure the safety of tourists and offer the necessary attention," he said.

Scientists are getting closer to finding life on Mars, according to a report 
December 27, 2018 12:06 


December 27, 2018 12:06 
Share! 
The landing of the InSight probe of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration of the USA (NASA) was the highlight in an extraordinary year for research on the so-called red planet. 


With a British-British seismometer and a German heat probe, the InSight probe is the first to study the interior of Mars. 


"It is the first time that we focus on studying the interior," explained Sot Lu Pan, planetary geologist at the University of Lyon. With other probes, such as Pathfinder or Curiosity, we study the environment of Mars to see if there is water, if there is ice, to see how the climate has changed over 4 million years. But this mission is different, we are going to place a seismometer on the surface of Mars. 


Everything went well for the InSight probe team from the landing. However, Mars has a reputation for surprising scientists and in 2018 it did so with a sandstorm that covered the entire planet. 


A fine dust covered the surface of the red planet and the vision darkened quickly for the Curiosity SUV. 


For the scientists, it was a unique opportunity. As Carine Vandaele of the Belgian Special Aeronautics Institute put it: "we had time to take some reference measurements before the storm, so we could see the whole evolution going from being a local storm to a global one, and then finally see how it dissipated. " 


Mars would come up with another surprise when the team of Italian researchers identified, thanks to a radar installed on the Mars Express probe of the European Space Agency, a saltwater lake of 20 kilometers at the Martian South Pole. 


"Water in a liquid state has always been a prerequisite for there to be life," said Hakan Svedhem, ExoMars project scientist at the European Space Agency. "It does not mean that there is, but it is a necessary condition for it to exist." 


The search for life on Mars has been taken seriously. The Russian-European SUV ExoMars, currently under construction, will be sent to the red planet in 2020. It already has six spacecraft and two probes. 


According to Professor of Experimental Physics at the University of Bern, Nicolas Thomas, "our vision of Mars has changed in the last 20 years. It is a much more dynamic planet than we imagined 20 years ago and it is because we now have high resolution observations with which we see the changes that are taking place ". 


Perhaps human beings can witness these changes within a decade, since the private company Space X has reiterated its intention to send humans to Mars before 2030.

The danger of ultra-right fashion 
December 27, 2018 13:09 


December 27, 2018 13:09 
Share! 
The United States, Europe and Latin America are regions where trends are becoming popular based on xenophobia, racism and homophobia, and many people ask why this change is due 


_________________________________________________________ 


Sarcastically it has been said that it has been said in the presidential elections the image of hard and bully removed votes. 


Today, on the other hand, the question seems to have been reversed: hard-line, far-right, totally conservative offers -to which should be added a message of racism, machismo, homophobia and xenophobia- seem to be the key to winning . 


In the United States and Europe we see, to the dismay of many, that political proposals and governments with neo-fascist characteristics are on the rise. For the 90s of the last century, that right tendency of the electorate did not exceed 10%; today it represents a quarter. Many countries have already opted for central governments or parliaments with a clear neofascist tendency, deeply racist and xenophobic. The trend seems to be increasing. Is it fashionable? In Latin America, with its own characteristics, that wave also seems to have arrived. What's going on? 


In France, Marine Le Pen, daughter of the ultraconservative Jean Marie Le Pen, obtains 33% of electoral preference in the presidential second round, being a key figure of the Gallic politics with her ignited neo-fascist discourse; in Germany, although constitutionally they are banned neo-Nazi parties and demonstrations, the far-right Alternative for Germany has 90 seats in Parliament; in Italy, a far-right coalition led by the xenophobic League of the North governs, who does not hide his will to separate himself from the "poor and underdeveloped" south; In Hungary (former republic of the Soviet orbit), Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, led by an ultra-nationalist far-right party, won two elections with more than 50% of the electorate. In Poland, also ex-State pro-Soviet, wins a proposal of the far right with the brothers Jaroslaw and Lech Kaczynski, rulers of the Orthodox party Law and Justice. Similar processes occur in Croatia, Czech Republic, Holland,even - to the surprise and desolation of many - in formerly social democratic countries and examples of tolerance and openness such as Sweden or Finland. 


Always in this logic of righting in the world view and politics, and putting scapegoats ahead such as irregular immigrants, in the United Kingdom of Great Britain wins a proposal like the Brexit, that is, the exit of the European Union (EU) in the name of an upright conservative nationalism, seeing immigration as a mortal danger. And in the United States the Presidency wins (and probably can repeat) an ultra-orthodox hardliner like Donald Trump, with his xenophobic call to build the wall to stop the "Hispanic criminals", plus an absolutely authoritarian and patriarchal way that, in instead of repelling, it gains votes. 


There seems to be a fever of the extreme right everywhere; also in Latin America we are witnessing these growing right-wing processes (Mauricio Macri in Argentina, Sebastián Piñera in Chile, Iván Duque in Colombia), ending with the retired military (and cunningly ultra-conservative) Jair Messias Bolsonaro in Brazil (who seems to have taken himself seriously). your middle name). 


A differentiation should be made between the extreme right of the North and that of Latin America. In developed countries, the United States and those of the European Union, we can speak of neofascism. It is not exactly what happens in Latin America. 


The neo-fascist or neo-Nazi regrets that are seen in the First World have very concrete causes, with clearly identified actors. The causes are material, economic, to which are added, of course, psychological-cultural factors that feed back the previous ones. The interwar German national-socialism, preparatory to the second world conflagration, had to do with the prostration of the Teutonic people and their impoverishment after the defeat in 1918. It was a project of economic reactivation, based on the crazy belief of being a "race" superior "destined to manage the world, with which it was possible to mobilize an entire people: proletariat and impoverished middle class.German pride moved with a quasi-apocalyptic message from a tremendously charismatic leader - Adolf Hitler - who could lead this discontent by transforming it into a warlike and expansionist spirit. The scapegoat of the case was, basically, the Jewish minority (along with others, always seen as "element to exterminate": gypsies, homosexuals, communists). 


That composition, which speaks of a situation of impoverishment, is repeated today. Why the resurgence of neo-fascist tendencies in Europe and the United States? Because the systemic crisis of capitalism that has dragged on for a decade, with the great financial crack of 2008, has not been solved, nor does it aim to do so. In addition to the prevailing neoliberal globalization, which makes many large multinational companies move their manufacturing plants from their home countries to the South (there is cheaper labor, no unions, no environmental regulations are respected or taxes are paid) . All this, together, contributes to an increasing impoverishment of the great working masses: the system and the loss of jobs are a time bomb. The "bad guy", for that matter, is given by immigrants (Africans and the Middle East mainly in Europe, Latin Americans for the United States), who, according to the ignited and lying neofascist discourse, "come to steal seats from national workers ". 


There always seems to be need for scapegoats (truth taught by psychology). "Hell is the others", masterfully summarized Jean Paul Sartre. The immigrant carries that burden: in addition to fleeing from their countries of origin due to the terrible conditions in which they live, they encounter the racist contempt of the citizens of the "developed" countries (is racism developed? But ... what is that development then? Is the lack of solidarity part of it?) 


The problem is not the migrants; migrations there were always, in all human history. The world was populated with humans because, immemorially, there were migrations to all corners of the planet, so there are no "pure races". That is a supremacist chimera that establishes and justifies a merciless economic exploitation. Why "work hard" will you say "work like black"? 


However, the ultra-conservative regrowth we are witnessing in Latin America has no similar motives. In any case, it is part of a universal "ideological wave", which perfectly complements the neoliberal policies under way, and which do not seem to be extinguished in the immediate future. As more and more the ideological-cultural war is waged through the mass media (the press has long ceased to be the "fourth power", now it is a core part of the same power), the pro-capitalist, privatist, anti-preaching -State, and of course viscerally anticommunist, has made a dent. If we add to that the fall of the first real socialisms and the failure of the recent progressives in Latin America (some of them have gotten bogged down, or have left power already based on the denunciations - exaggerated fake news through corruption - others),It is clear that the slave is made to think with the master's head ("The dominant ideology is the ideology of the ruling class", Marx and Engels sentenced more than 150 years ago, and they were not mistaken). 


In these Latin American lands there have been, since modern nation-states exist, authoritarian governments, military dictatorships in many cases. They are fascists in their political mode: non-democratic, vertical, bloodthirsty with dissidents. But they are not in economic terms, at least not in the same way as they are for the countries of the North. What we witness now is an enthronement of a media discourse that seems to respond to a "fashion", a generalized trend that seems to sweep everything: "Being right is fashionable," said Pedro Almodóvar biting. The "fashion" has also reached Latin America. As always, at least until now, the trends are set by the North; the South repeats with pale and dull copies. 


In Hungary, a far-right and ultra-nationalist party won two elections with more than 50% of the electorate. 
Anyway, for the great popular field anywhere in the world, this wave is always bad news: spaces are closed, any form is criminalized of protest, there is a very dangerous verticalism. All of which facilitates the deepening of the exploitation of the worker (urban industrial worker, agricultural proletariat, housewife, worker in general, be it professional with a doctorate), exploitation and alienated work that remain the foundation stone of capitalism. 


It is not clear what will happen in the short and medium term. What is clear is that the capitalist system is locked and can not find an outlet. Unless, as happened in the 30s of the last century, after the great crisis of 1929, the exit (if that can be called such) is a new global war. There are worrying signs that this might happen. We all think that rationality will prevail, because a world war today, with nuclear weapons, could simply mean the end of the human species. But the possibilities of that holocaust, unfortunately, are given. 


Before this advance of the ultra right (with patriarchal machismo, homophobia and retrogressive conservative speeches included), as a popular camp, as lefts, as progressive beings, we must oppose the most stubborn resistance: denounce, clarify, carry another ideological message, organize, prepare for the battle. Who said the tremendous stupidity that the story was over and there were no more class struggles? There is no doubt that now revolutionary advances are not very possible. The triumph of neoliberalism and big capital was enormous, and the ideological struggle, nowadays, seems to be won by the right, now in its version of the far right. For the popular field today is, in any case, a time of resistance and reorganization. But the long struggle for the betterment of humanity has not ended, at all.

Mexican economy will face tough test in first year of new government, according to expert 
December 27, 2018 16:06 


December 27, 2018 16:06 
Share! 
The Mexican economy will have a hard test in 2019 among several unknowns about whether the new government's plans can provide the necessary support to the uncertain global atmosphere, experts said. 


Mexico showed more resistance than expected in 2018, with increases in interest rates of the central bank of Mexico and the uncertainty marked by the renegotiation of the North American trade agreement, explained the chief economist for Latin America of Continuum Economics, Pedro Toast 


"But the enthusiasm of the market has shifted 180 degrees after the election (of President) Andrés Manuel López Obrador, and now there is widespread pessimism regarding the policies of the incoming government, "Tuesta told Xinhua. 


"You can not see how the new government will accomplish its promises without breaking the budget, and there is a clear willingness to use interventionist solutions in the energy and agricultural markets, which could bring a cost to society," he added. 


An expected drop in investment confidence led Tuesta to lower recently ITS forecast for the growth of Mexico's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2019, to 1.8 percent from the previous 2.2 percent, with a "high" risk "of a new cut. 


For now , explained Tuesta, consumption and fiscal expansion could prevent a "more dramatic" slowdown. " 


López Obrador, of the leftist Movimiento Regeneración Nacional (Morena), has promised to boost the country's economic growth by fighting corruption in government finances. , to allocate those resources to productive projects. 


His government, which began functions on December 1, presented its budget plan to Congress on December 15, which generated several questions on some economic variables, although in general terms it gave relief to preserve the fiscal discipline that the country has followed for years. 


The Mexican Congress on December 24 gave final approval to the budget next year without major changes compared to the original proposal. 


The general director of analysis of the Mexican rating agency HR Ratings, Felix Boni, explained that the budget structure of López Obrador is positive, but it will be necessary to pay particular attention to certain variables. 


"The price of oil, the level of oil production, the exchange rate and inflation are the main risks," explained the expert. 


"Obviously the part that must be seen is the impact for states and municipalities, and the implementation of the budget according to the guidelines they are presenting," he added. 


The new government, which replaces the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI, center), estimates economic growth of between 1.5 and 2.5 percent by 2019, with an inflation rate of 3.4 percent. 


The price of the Mexican crude oil mix was at an average of 55 dollars per barrel for 2019, from 62 dollars last year, with a production platform of 1,847 million barrels per day, very stable against the 1,849 million barrels expected. for 2018. 


The López Obrador government set out to reach a primary surplus of 1 percent in 2019 and maintain a stable level of indebtedness, one of the analysts' concerns. 


The CEO of HR Ratings, Fernando Montes de Oca, said that the figures, in general, are a factor of confidence in the new administration for giving conservative signals and fiscal discipline. 


"In the next 12 to 18 months we will be evaluating what are the policies and the results from the economic point of view," the executive explained. 


"We will see in the first months of 2019 how the budget is going to be exercised and if it will really meet expectations," he added. 


The rating agency Moody's Investors Service highlighted, for its part, that the budget of 289,000 million dollars anticipates a slower than expected increase in spending, and leaves little room for maneuver in the event of an eventuality due to an external shock. 


For his part, the chief economist of Grupo Financiero BBVA-Bancomer in Mexico, Carlos Serrano, agreed that the economic package of the new government is "realistic", but suggested making quarterly reviews to evaluate its results. 


For 2019, BBVA-Bancomer estimates an economic growth for Mexico of 2 percent, very similar to the 1.9 percent of 2018, although with a downward bias. 


Serrano said that the main global risks for the country are in a less synchronized growth of the global economy. 


Other contingencies are the eventual greater financial tensions in emerging markets, as well as the process of normalization of monetary policy in the United States. 


Although Mexico will continue to show "inertial" growth in 2019, the new government of the second largest Latin American economy after Brazil, has a firm framework to deal with possible external and internal adversities. 


"The fundamentals of the Mexican economy are among the most solid in the emerging world, with low and controlled inflation, an independent central bank, absence of external vulnerabilities and ordered fiscal accounts," Serrano told Xinhua. 


"And one very important thing: the country has enough international reserves, even without the credit line with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), to face all the obligations in foreign currency in the span of a year, which is a problem in other countries, "he said. 


By 2019, manufacturing and private consumption will continue to show a positive evolution, consolidating as the main engines of economic growth, while doubts persist about the recovery of investment, given the context of uncertainty with the new government, Serrano said.

Oil prices started on the week on the rise due to concerns about falling supplies 
December 25, 2018 13:25 


December 25, 2018 13:25 
Share! 
The fall in the amounts of the so-called black gold caused the US shale oil factories, one of the leading producers, to reduce drilling plans for next year, according to specialized reports, to Prensa Latina news agency reported. PL). 


In this environment, Brent oil from the North Sea rose 60 cents and was quoted at 54.42 dollars per barrel. 


This Monday the American West Texas Intermediate also behaved upward and changed hands to 45.96 units the barrel. 


Fears associated with excess supply and a slowdown in the global economy characterized the oil price, which, at this juncture, maintained a downward trend over the past week. 


Although the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) planned last November an estimated cut in 1, 2 million barrels per day from 2019, analysts estimate that this could have little impact on the price of oil if investors they are confident in a sustained increase in the US pumping. 


Oil prices fell since last October in the face of global economic fragility and fears of excess in the market due to the increase in production in the United States. 


Specialists point to the double standard of Washington, which tries to present itself as an advocate of lower prices, while on the other hand it does the opposite, with its measures of punishment for Iran and its participation in the war in Syria to support terrorist groups .

"The worst is yet to come": Experts predict an even greater collapse of the markets in 2019 
December 25, 2018 15:30

Share ! 
The collapse of the stock markets in the bearish territory -characterized by a fall of 20% or more since its recent peak- could worsen in 2019. This is the opinion of several experts consulted by CNBC, who point out the possibility of risk as the main risk factors. That the Federal Reserve (Fed) further increases interest rates or uncertainty about future trade relations between Washington and Beijing. 


"The worst is yet to come" 
"I think the worst is yet to come next year, we are still in the first half of a global stock market," predicts Mark Jolley, global strategist at CCB International Securities, who confesses that he " would love to be more optimistic, "but that he does not see" too many positive aspects ". For Jolley, the big risk lies in the credit markets. This analyst explains that, with two further increases in interest rates projected by the Fed in 2019, companies will find it difficult to pay their debts, which will cause the default or degradation of some of them. The weakness in the credit markets will be extended to the shares, the expert details, warning that this situation will affect "undoubtedly" sectors of high growth,such as technology.  






For his part, Mizuho Bank's head of economy and strategy, Vishnu Varathan, estimates that investors have less reason to be optimistic now, since the Fed's monetary policy adjustment means there will be less money for investments. 


Commercial uncertainty 
Finally, Vasu Menon, vice president of asset management at OCBC Bank, points to the uncertainties on the trade front, because, even though the US-based tariff wars are on the rise. and China will be paused until the beginning of March, it is still early to know what will happen next. 


"The valuations seem attractive, but you have to have a strong appetite for risk, because I think the markets are going to be very hectic," says the expert.

POLITICS Advertising space Ten essential discs of 2018 A thin line between the Latin and the Anglo-Saxon in a summary for all tastes WILLIAM PADRÓN 12/24/2018 01:00 am Latino and Anglo, two worlds that run into counts, summaries and trends. The first celebrates its greatest exposure in the global market; the second yields amazed. A year marked by the feminine presence, where the urban and the trap were the constants before a rock that continues giving sublime lunges and a pop that merges with elements of the musical avant-garde.
































The emotionality is still the source of food even if it is social networks that steal the prominence of the billboards and is also the measure for all genres. 


Here a referential summary of ten albums to enjoy and look back in 2018. From Cardi B to Draco Rosa, Paul McCartney, Rosalía and Artic Monkeys, including Kali Uchis, Janelle Monáe, J Balvin, Mon Laferte and Parquet Courts. What is not said that there is not for all tastes! 


From the summary can draw some conclusions. The first of them is that the music made in the continent has managed to be among the great world stars of music. The second is that with increasing insistence, the musical genres permeate and merge to conceive the sonorities of these times, always eclectic. 


Without pretending to set an irremovable list here, the selection has been made on the basis of the musical contributions of the chosen artists. 


Invasion of Privacy. Cardi B. Honest, direct, sarcastic and even funny, the New York singer Cardi B tells her story in her own way without neglecting aspects such as feminism, violence, success, coexistence with fame, sex and that form of agglutinate everything in a hip hop that feeds on the R & B, which sounds like a trap that embraces the Latin. In addition, it has a list of luxury guests: Migos, J Balvin, Bad Bunny, Chance The Rapper and SZA. 








Sacred mount. Draco Rosa. One of the best albums of his career. Hard rock transformed into nostalgic blues and tribal psychedelia. Draco went to hell to tell his demons that he survived. Album of celebration, gratitude, introspection and liberation. Grunge boleristico that embarrasses with jazzist bass lines and a visceral prog-rock. There is evidence of the anxiety to make a rock album where the grunt of the volatile beast of the industry marks its destiny. 








Egypt Station. Paul MCCARTNEY. The former Beatle reaffirms that he is one of the most creative composers in history, one of the few who remain alive of his generation. Its elegance, precision and combination of a timeless pop and a sophisticated rock and roll, give a particularity to the album. McCartney knows he made a great record and takes part in the new culture expositiva to strut with an album full of hits, like someone who tastes the triumph of a modern songbook. 








The malquerer. Rosalía Framed in a toxic relationship as the premise of this conceptual album, the young Spanish woman uses her soprano voice to give a new air to flamenco that mixes with soul, R & B, flirts with hip hop and before her connection with art-pop. it gives a refreshing imprint to the sum of its primary influences. His personal daring gives cohesion to this album. An artist who does not have to take her eyes off her. 








Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino. Arctic Monkeys. An album oriented towards pop loungue, with soft and melodious distorted guitars identifying jazz aspects. Turner acts as a crooner fed by French composers such as Serge Gainsbourg and François de Roubaix and references to neo-noir cinema beyond Alphaville, Point Blank and The Long Goodbye. The comparison with Father John Misty, David Bowie, Leonard Cohen and The Beach Boys is inevitable. 








Isolation. Kali Uchis. The Colombian raised in the United States takes a big leap with this production that highlights the mix of Latin roots, Anglo-Saxon influences and winks to the black culture. Although its center is pop, the deployment of genres such as new soul, R & B, funk, hip hop or reggaeton is present. Solid collaborations that go from Gorillaz, Jorja Smith, Tyler The Creator, Bootsy Collins, Reykon or Steve Lacy give amplitude to his sonorous radar. 








Dirty Computer. Janelle Monáe Insistent and determined. This third work magnifies the musical work that Janelle has been doing. Theirs is on the path of pop, funk, hip hop, R & B and neo-soul. It is a tribute to women and sexual identity. It has guests like Brian Wilson, Zoë Kravitz, Grimes and Pharrell Williams. At times it carries an almost nostalgic sound that is paired with the avant-garde attitude of its creator. 






You vibrate J Balvin. That J Balvin opens the record with Mexican pop singer / songwriter Carla Morrison is a declaration of principles, an opening message. It is a reggaetón that opts for the dance hall and R & B, ambitious, danceable and with an honest lyric in its message. It is played with guests such as Willy Williams, Zion & Lennox, Rosalia, Anita, Wisin and Yandel. At a time when the genre itself is approaching a fade out, Balvin finds a way to keep it afloat as a piece to look at in retrospect. 








Rule. Mon Laferte. The Chilean girl always manages to impress with her music. This time he met with Omar Rodríguez-López (Mars Volta), in production, and with engineer Bruce Botnick (The Doors), to record the record in one shot with 13 musicians. A conceptual work that portrays several stages of love between cumbia, bolero, mambo and salsa, to be packaged in a Latin pop that accounts for their emotional emotional states. Each song has a video. 








Wide Awake! Parquet Courts. The sixth album of the Americans, more than a new indie rock effort, is a punk trip, asound revival in which the social plays an important role. His sonic cohesion, the impetus of his riffs, as well as melodies, make the perfect game to the moments of global agitation with a disquieting sonic tune. His provocative speech is motivated according to the times that he lived and, in that sense, the comparison to The Clash fits in the context.

A tool designed by the civil association Netblocks and the Internet Society allows real-time calculations of the economic impact of Internet blockades, mobile dating restrictions and social network restrictions, including bandwidth limitation. Cocuyo portal effect   . 


The study that was published online last December 10 under the name Cost of Shutdown Toll (Cost) allows you to specify countries, services and duration. 




In the case of Venezuela, restricting access to the Internet implies an opportunity cost of more than 400 million dollars per day. This figure rises to more than 147 billion dollars each year. 


The methodology used by Cost uses public data from the World Bank, the International Telecommunications Institute (ITU), Eurostat and the US census. 


But the tool also allows research by regions, cities and specific online services. For example, if only Miranda and Whatsapp are considered, the daily economic impact is of 645.879 dollars. If it's just Maracaibo and Instagram, the cost would be $ 537,194. By measuring separately any social network or messaging service, the tool yields the same daily result: 7,720,392 dollars. 


"This new tool will boost the next stage of the defense of access to data. By calculating the figures in real time, Cost will allow us to communicate to governments and technology companies how much revenue they are losing when they interrupt the Internet. We hope that this will make governments think twice before threatening the freedom of the Internet, "said Hannah Machlin, head of global defense at NetBlocks about its launch. 


In May 2017 the Internet Society published a statement expressing "deep concern about the Internet blockades in Venezuela."

Russian President Vladimir Putin warned that the danger of a nuclear scenario is not taking seriously. 


"The danger of such a scenario is underestimated, and this could lead to the destruction of civilization," the Russian leader said. 


Putin said that Russia will respond reciprocally if the United States abandons the treaty on medium-range and shorter missiles. The Russian leader said that Russia has made progress in maintaining nuclear parity. 


At another point of the press conference Putin referred to the policy of international sanctions against his country. 


The Russian leader said that Russia's economy has adapted to international sanctions, highlighting for example the growth of the agricultural sector. 


Putin referred to the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, noting the lack of international sanctions against Saudi Arabia. "Skripal is alive but there are sanctions against Russia," the president added. 


On China, Putin highlighted the level of confidence in the relationship between his country and China and   the international collaboration assuring that "it is a factor for global stability". 


Referring to Syria, Vladimir Putin said that progress is being made in a solution to the war by political means referring to the efforts together with Iran and Turkey for the creation of the constitutional committee in Syria. On the announcement of the withdrawal of troops by the US, Putin was optimistic about the announcement of Donald Trump, however he recalled the 17 years of the US military presence in Afghanistan. "The presence of US troops in Syria was illegal, our troops are in Syrian territory at the invitation of President Bashar al Assad," he added.  










Russian President Vladimir Putin is attending his traditional face-to-face meeting with the local and international press on Thursday. 


At the beginning of the meeting with journalists, Vladimir Putin, offered an economic balance in which he indicated that "Russia must change the structure of its economy to achieve significant GDP growth." More than 1,700 journalists from almost all Russian regions, Asia, Europe and America are accredited for a press conference.

The Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) warned that the monetary financing of the Central Bank of Venezuela (BCV) is one of the reasons for hyperinflation that plagues Venezuelans. 


The regional body of the United Nations released its last economic report of the year, the Preliminary Overview of the Economies of Latin America and the Caribbean 2018, at a press conference headed by its Executive Secretary, Alicia Bárcena, in Santiago, Chile. 


In the preliminary balance of the economies of Latin America and the Caribbean, the agency said that inflation accelerated during the first 10 months of 2018 and since November 2017 the monthly inflation rate of the economy exceeds 50 percent, " which would have entered a process of hyperinflation ".  


"Among the reasons behind this high figure are the monetary financing by the central bank to the public sector -which motivates the growth of the monetary aggregates, which in the case of the monetary base exceeded 30,000% in October 2018- and the consequent depreciations observed in the official and parallel exchange rates, "he explained. 


On the other hand, Cepal informed that Venezuela would suffer a contraction of its economy of 10 percent; Nicaragua -2 percent and Argentina -1.8 percent. 


According to the document, the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean will face a complex global economic scenario in the coming years, in which a reduction in the dynamics of growth is expected, both in developed countries and emerging economies, accompanied by a increase in the volatility of the international financial markets. Added to this is the structural weakening of international trade, aggravated by trade tensions between the United States and China. 


The projection of economic growth for Latin America and the Caribbean in 2019 is 1.7%, slightly lower than that reported by ECLAC last October (1.8%), while the estimate for the current year (2018) also it was slightly reduced to 1.2% (from the 1.3% reported in October). 


"Public policies are required to strengthen the sources of growth and deal with the global uncertainty," said Bárcena.

The Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) warned that the monetary financing of the Central Bank of Venezuela (BCV) is one of the reasons for hyperinflation that plagues Venezuelans. 


The regional body of the United Nations released its last economic report of the year, the Preliminary Overview of the Economies of Latin America and the Caribbean 2018, at a press conference headed by its Executive Secretary, Alicia Bárcena, in Santiago, Chile. 


In the preliminary balance of the economies of Latin America and the Caribbean, the agency said that inflation accelerated during the first 10 months of 2018 and since November 2017 the monthly inflation rate of the economy exceeds 50 percent, " which would have entered a process of hyperinflation ".  


"Among the reasons behind this high figure are the monetary financing by the central bank to the public sector -which motivates the growth of the monetary aggregates, which in the case of the monetary base exceeded 30,000% in October 2018- and the consequent depreciations observed in the official and parallel exchange rates, "he explained. 


On the other hand, Cepal informed that Venezuela would suffer a contraction of its economy of 10 percent; Nicaragua -2 percent and Argentina -1.8 percent. 


According to the document, the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean will face a complex global economic scenario in the coming years, in which a reduction in the dynamics of growth is expected, both in developed countries and emerging economies, accompanied by a increase in the volatility of the international financial markets. Added to this is the structural weakening of international trade, aggravated by trade tensions between the United States and China. 


The projection of economic growth for Latin America and the Caribbean in 2019 is 1.7%, slightly lower than that reported by ECLAC last October (1.8%), while the estimate for the current year (2018) also it was slightly reduced to 1.2% (from the 1.3% reported in October). 


"Public policies are required to strengthen the sources of growth and deal with the global uncertainty," said Bárcena.

Trump surprises allies by ordering withdrawal of US troops from Syria 
The measure would have important geopolitical consequences and raises questions regarding the future of the Kurdish militias supported by the United States that fight against ISIS in the AFP area 12/20/2018 10: 12 am Washington.- The allied countries of the United States were surprised this Thursday, after President Donald Trump declared victory over the jihadist group Islamic State (ISIS) in Syria and ordered the withdrawal of US troops from that country.


















The decision ignored the opinion of legislators, the Pentagon and allies. Paris and London warned on Thursday that the fight against jihadists in Syria is not over. While Russian President Vladimir Putin considered the decision "correct", reported AFP. 


Trump had assured the day before, in a video posted on Twitter: "We won against ISIS ... We recovered the territory and now it's time for our troops to return home." 


The measure would have important geopolitical consequences and raise questions regarding the future of the Kurdish militias supported by the United States that fight against ISIS in the area, where it is believed that thousands of jihadists remain. 


The withdrawal of US troops will allow ISIS to rebuild, warned the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), dominated by the Kurds and allies of the international anti-jihadist coalition led by the United States. 


A US official said Trump's decision became final on Tuesday. "Total withdrawal, total means total," said the official, who spoke under anonymity and specified that the order will be executed "as quickly as possible." 


There are currently some 2,000 US troops in Syria, mostly on training and advisory missions to local forces fighting ISIS. 


The Department of Defense has already started the withdrawal "process," said a spokesman for that portfolio. US lawmakers criticized the move and said it could give Ankara strength to attack Kurdish militants. 


Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said the decision is imprudent and puts the Kurds "at risk." While Democratic Senator Jack Reed considered the withdrawal tantamount to a "betrayal" of the Kurds, he "provides additional evidence of President Trump's inability to lead the world stage." 


Trump had already expressed skepticism about the presence in Syria and in March he said he wanted to bring the troops back "soon". However, his advisers and international allies warned him of a hasty withdrawal and the mission spread. 


White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said, however, that the US-led coalition that includes dozens of nations will continue to fight the jihadists. "These victories against EI in Syria do not mark the end of the global coalition campaign," he said in a statement. 


The announcement did not specify, however, what effect the withdrawal of troops will have on air operations in Syria, which the United States has been developing since 2014. 


What about the Kurdish fighters? 
Washington supports the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG), the backbone of the Arab-Kurdish coalition. But for Turkey the YPG is an "active terrorist organization". 


Ankara has already warned that it will launch an operation "in the coming days" against the territory controlled by Kurdish forces in northern Syria. 


The link between the United States and Turkey, an important ally in NATO, has been strained in recent times due to this alliance between Washington and the Kurds. But the decision does not only mark a break for the Kurds, but goes against the policy maintained by Washington for years for Syria and the region. 


Last week, Brett McGurk, special envoy to defeat ISIS, said: "If we have learned something in these years, it is that guaranteeing the defeat of a group like ISIS means that you can not only win in your territorial space and then leave." 


"It remains a threat" 
A statement from the British government, which has supported the campaign against ISIS in Syria for years, warned that there is still "much left to be done" against the jihadists. 


"We do not have to lose sight of the threat they pose, even without territory, Daesh (ISIS) remains a threat," the Foreign Ministry said in a statement released on Wednesday. 


The Times newspaper also reported on Thursday that the UK was not informed of the decision before Trump's announcement. France, on its side, assured that it will maintain its military presence in Syria. 


"Daesh has not been erased from the map, nor its roots," French Minister of European Affairs Nathalie Loiseau said Thursday . The US presence in Syria is considered key to curbing Russian and Iranian influence. 


Pro-Iranian militias have supported the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, and Moscow also entered the conflict in 2015 to shore it up. Charles Lister, principal investigator of the Middle East Institute of Washington, considers this decision "extraordinarily short-term and naive". 


"This measure will seem more like a 'withdrawal' than a 'victory' and is another evidence of the dangerous unpredictability of the US president," said Lister, adding that it not only favors the US but also Russia, Iran and Assad.

Cepal advertising space : Venezuela registered the worst economic performance during 2018 
Venezuela's GDP fell for the fifth consecutive year, by 15%, with an accumulated contraction of 44.3% compared to 2013 GDP, the Economic Commission for Latin America pointed out. Latin America and the Caribbean AFP 20/12/2018 12:54 pm Santiago.- Venezuela is the country with the worst economic performance in the region during 2018, reported the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) in its latest report economic. Its GDP was reduced for the fifth consecutive year, by 15%, with an accumulated contraction of 44.3% compared to 2013 GDP, as a consequence of the crisis faced by the Government of Nicolás Maduro.






















Nicaragua, also plunged into a political crisis that has impacted on trade and mainly on tourism, will suffer a 4.1% drop in GDP this year, compared to the 4.9% expansion of the previous year, according to AFP. 


The forecast for Argentina is a fall of 2.6% in 2018, after registering an economic growth of 2.9% in 2017, mainly driven by the currency crisis. 


For 2019, the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean expects the Argentine economy to register a new contraction of 1.8%, despite "a slight recovery in the real income of families, an improvement in the agricultural harvest and the continuation of of the growth of the commercial partners, with a positive impact on private consumption, investment and exports ". 


On the other hand, Brazil, the largest economy at the regional level, maintained a slow rate of expansion, so the expectation for the end of 2018 is a growth of 1.3%, not far from the 1.1% recorded on the previous year. 


In this way, the South American giant still "has not fully overcome the recession observed between 2015 and 2016," says ECLAC. 


For the next year, it is estimated a 2% growth in its GDP. 


The Dominican Republic leads regional growth, with an expansion of 6.3%, a significant increase compared to 4.6% in 2017, as a result, according to ECLAC, of ??the robust growth of the US economy (USA). ), its main commercial partner and largest source of remittances and tourists. 


It is followed by Bolivia, whose economy continues to show a strong dynamism, with a projected growth of 4.4% for this year, thanks to an increase in public investment and consumption. For its part, the economy of Latin America will grow by 1.7% in 2019, in a scenario in which "global uncertainties will be greater and from different fronts", which will impact the prices of raw materials, ECLAC announced this Thursday. 






After registering an expansion of 1.2% this year, slightly below 2017 - driven by private consumption and a slight recovery of investments and exports - Latin American countries will live again in 2019 a year marked by uncertainty world, says the latest economic report of ECLAC, a technical agency of the United Nations based in Santiago. 


According to the report, Latin America and the Caribbean will face "a complex global economic scenario in the coming years, in which a reduction in the dynamics of growth is expected, both in developed countries and in emerging economies, accompanied by an increase in the volatility of international financial markets. " 


Additionally, a structural weakening of international trade was projected, aggravated by commercial tensions between the United States and China. 


As a result of this scenario of uncertainty, ECLAC projects a drop of 7% in the prices of basic products, drivers of regional economic growth, by 2019. 


The value of minerals and metals, key especially for South American countries, will decrease by an average of 5%, while agricultural products will decrease by 2%, according to forecasts. 


For oil, a fall of 16% is expected. "Public policies are needed to strengthen the sources of growth and face the global uncertainty," said Alicia Bárcena, executive secretary of ECLAC, presenting the report at a press conference.

Sanders said that the US will continue to work with its allies to "deny Islamist terrorists territory, funding and support," in addition to avoiding "any infiltration" within US borders. 


He added that the country and its partners "are ready to rejoin at all levels to defend the interests of Americans wherever necessary." 


Earlier, Trump had stressed on Twitter that his "only reason" for remaining in Syria was the defeat of the IS, an objective that his government considers fulfilled after having snatched from the extremists almost all the territory they occupied in 2014. 


"We have defeated the EI in Syria, the only reason to be there during the presidency of Trump, "the president said on Twitter. 


Local media outlets had earlier today, citing Pentagon officials, that Trump had decided to immediately withdraw from Syria the 2,000 soldiers who are fighting as part of an international coalition against jihadism. 


Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanayahu said he respects the US decision to withdraw from Syria and warned that his country will "protect" itself from the new situation. 


Trump has repeated on several occasions that his priority in Syria is to eradicate the IS and has abandoned the idea of ??forcing a transition that forces the departure of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad. 


According to the Pentagon, the IS only has 1% of the territory that it dominated in 2014, when it proclaimed a caliphate in Syria and Iraq.

Bolsonaro will take Brazil out of the Global Migration Pact 
December 19, 2018 8:00 


December 19, 2018 8:00 
Share! 
The elected president of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, announces that his country will withdraw from the Global Migration Pact to avoid "suffering" like that of France. 


In a live broadcast made through the social network Facebook on Tuesday, Bolsonaro lamented that the current chancellor, Aloysio Nunes, recently signed the document of the United Nations (UN) for migration, along with about 160 countries, and which aims to strengthen international cooperation for a "safe, orderly and regular" migration. 


"Unfortunately, the current Minister of Foreign Affairs of Brazil (Aloysio Nunes Ferreira) signed that treaty," said Bolsonaro. 


In this way, the far right-winners of the presidential elections and who will be sworn in on January 1-condemned the decision of the government of the acting president, Michel Temer, to subscribe to the global agreement promoted by the UN. 


Everyone knows what is happening in France, explained the Brazilian politician and then add that this situation makes it "unbearable" to live in some parts of the European country while growing intolerance to migrants. 


In his opinion, the French people have welcomed refugees in the "best possible way", but they "want to assert" their culture, their rights and privileges brought from their countries of origin to the place where they have received them. Consequently, Bolsonaro ruled that "now France is suffering because of this". 


Noting that he does not want a situation similar to France to occur in Brazil, Bolsonaro said he is not against immigrants, but he is in favor of regulating the entry of migrants to their country with more rigorous criteria. 


In February, the Government of France, chaired by Emanuel Macron, introduced a new immigration reform that would tighten control over the entry and application for asylum in this European country.

The price of Brent crude oil has fallen below $ 56 per barrel on Tuesday for the first time since October 12, 2017. That loss represents more than 6% of its value. 


Futures contracts for Brent crude plummeted to $ 55.91 per unit, before rising to 56.07. 


The main factor that put pressure on oil prices was the increase in concerns about the risk of excess supply of raw materials. Investors saw signs of a slowdown in global growth. 


Shortly before, crude oil had fallen below $ 57 per barrel for the first time since October 20, 2017.

They find dust particles from the Sahara at distances that defy gravity 
December 19, 2018 8:11 


December 19, 2018 8:11 
Share! 
Large amounts of dust particles from the Sahara desert were found at a distance of up to 3,500 kilometers in the Caribbean, which could be a contribution to global warming, according to a study led by the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research. (NIOZ) and recently published in the journal Science Advances. 


The dust affects the delicate balance between incoming sunlight and heat from the Earth, the development of tropical cyclones and the formation of clouds. The winds transport dust particles from the west of the Sahara to the Atlantic Ocean. 


The scientists collected samples of that dust in floating buoys and underwater sediment traps in five places in the Atlantic Ocean between 2013 and 2016. 


"The existing ideas do not conceive that such massive particles travel in the atmosphere at such long distances, which suggests that there is an atmospheric process, or a combination of still unknown processes, that keeps them in the air, "explained one of the authors of the study. study, Giles Harrison, quoted by the scientific portal Phys.org. 


"This evidence that dust and ash are transported that are significant, because those particles influence the transfer of radiation around the Earth and the carbon cycles in the oceans," Harrison added. 


The role of large particles is underestimated. 
In addition, the size of the found patrols is 0.45 millimeters in diameter, which means that they are almost 50 times larger than scientists thought it was possible to transport at such a distance through of global winds. 


The authors of the study argued that this indicates that the role of large dust particles, especially quartz, both in the formation of clouds and in the carbon cycle in the oceans, has been underestimated. 


According to the researchers, the role they play in the atmosphere, with its unexpected long-range effects, should be included in future climate models. 


The study also suggests that the amount of dust removed from the atmosphere by rain, and not by gravity, is greater than previously assumed. This has implications for the oceans, since the droplets formed by the dust particles are very acidic. In addition, large particles sink faster, bringing nutrients to the deepest parts of the ocean. 


Both factors affect the growth of algae and, therefore, food chains and the carbon cycle in the ocean.

Russian President Vladimir Putin urged the Armed Forces to strengthen the country's capacity to deal with external threats. 


"The consolidation of defensive capacity and national security (...) in the face of external threats were and will be our most important tasks," Putin said at a meeting with senior officials of the Ministry of Defense. 


The president indicated that the political leadership and all of the citizens of the country understand the importance of this task. 


At the meeting Putin said that "all types of troops have developed in a balanced manner according to the plans and the new state arms programs have been equipped with modern models of weapons and equipment. preserving global parity, has been significantly strengthened, "Russia Today quoted. 


In that sense, I have indicated that the percentage of innovative weapons in the Russian nuclear triad amounted to 82%. 


Russia's most advanced weapons will protect the country from aggression and guarantee stability in the world for said Vladimir Putin and pointed out the success of the tests of the new Sarmat ballistic missile, the launch of the mass production of the Avangard hypersonic missile and the commissioning of the Kinzhal hypersonic system. 


"This weapon multiplies the capacity of the Army and the Navy, in a way that reliably and unconditionally guarantees the security of Russia for the coming decades, strengthens the balance of forces and, therefore, stability in the world. I hope our new systems will make those who are accustomed to militaristic and aggressive rhetoric think ", said the Russian leader. 


Vladimir Putin said that in 2019 Russia will continue to strengthen the combat potential of strategic nuclear forces. 


The Russian president noted that the defense budget of the United States amounts to 725,000 million dollars, while Russia spends 46,000 million dollars and plans to reduce these expenses in percentage terms. 


"We see disparity in financing between the main military powers," he said.
