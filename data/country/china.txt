A: Since the publication of the "Opinions", the civil affairs departments at all levels and the Chamber of Commerce of the Association have thoroughly studied and implemented the spirit of the "Opinions", took the initiative, actively regulated, and achieved important results. The first is to unify thinking and understanding. The Chamber of Commerce of the Association has raised the political position and stood at the height of " serving the country, serving the society, serving the masses, and serving the industry " to understand the issue of fees. From the perspective of "the river is dry and no river " , it recognizes the importance of reducing the burden of enterprises. The ideological understanding has been unified to the spirit of the Party Central Committee and the State Council. The second is to actively regulate the charging behavior. In accordance with the requirements of the "Opinions", the Chamber of Commerce of the Association actively adjusts the norms and fees, actively reduces excessive charges, and consciously stops illegal charges. Judging from the annual inspections of the first batch of national associations, 90% of the association's chambers of commerce have actively regulated the charging behavior. The third is the establishment of a standing bank. If a few association chambers of commerce fail to regulate the charging behavior in a timely manner for various reasons, they will be able to admit mistakes, take the initiative to correct them, and promptly rectify them after receiving the rectification notice from the registration management organ. However, we also found that a small number of associations are not self-regulating and self-reformed. There are still very few associations and chambers of commerce that are still lucky. The number of charges is illegal. Although the number is small, the amount is small, but the impact is bad. Therefore, the civil affairs departments at all levels must continue to attach great importance to the clean-up of the fees and charges related to enterprises, and continue to increase the intensity of propaganda, guidance, management, investigation and exposure of this work.
 
Reporter: What do the industry associations' Chambers focus on in terms of corporate fees?
 
A: The Chamber of Commerce of the majority of industry associations should further study the decision-making arrangements and relevant policy documents of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, improve political positions, establish a sense of the overall situation, and implement the clean-up and regulation of enterprise-related charges as an important task to implement. The principle of the road, there are orders to be enforced, there is a prohibition, resolutely stop the illegal charges, regulate the charging behavior, reduce excessive charges, and effectively reduce the burden on enterprises. First, the Chamber of Commerce of Industry Associations should regulate the behavior of membership fees. According to the "Opinions", the Chamber of Commerce of Industry Associations comprehensively sorts out and standardizes the existing membership fees. If the industry association chamber of commerce and the branch (representative) organization repeatedly collect the membership fee, they shall immediately and unconditionally cancel the branch (representative) organization's membership fee standard, and shall not continue to collect; if the membership fee standard exceeds 4 files, it must be adjusted to 4 files and below, and the same membership fee. Grades may not be subdivided into different standards; industry associations that collect fees based on production and sales, enterprise scale, etc., must set the upper limit of the membership fee reasonably, must be adjusted to 4 files and below, and determine the level of each grade on the basis of reasonable calculation. The amount is clarified, and the same grade is charged at a clear amount. In short, if it is inconsistent with the new provisions and new requirements of the Opinions, it will be rectified in 2018. Second, the Chamber of Commerce of Industry Associations should regulate the operation of service charges. The Chamber of Commerce of Industry Associations shall, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the laws and regulations on the obligations of operators and the principle of voluntary paid services, conduct business service activities within the scope of its purposes and business, and regulate relevant charging activities. For the government pricing management, strictly implement the charging standards set by the competent pricing department; for the implementation of market adjustment prices, in accordance with the principles of fairness, lawfulness, honesty and trustworthiness, the fees and charges shall be determined and disclosed publicly, and services with matching quality and price shall be provided. Industry association chambers of commerce are not allowed to impose services and charges. Third, the industry consultation meeting must resolutely stop the violation of the rules and conduct the evaluation and charging. The Chamber of Commerce of Industry Associations shall carry out the appraisal and approval procedures in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Interim Provisions on the Administration of Social Organizations' Rating and Commendation Activities (National Evaluation Group [2012] No. 2). Approved evaluation and compliance activities must comply with the purposes and business scope stipulated in the charter, and strictly implement the approved awards and conditions. The appraisal of the standard should be based on the principles of fairness, justice, openness and non-profit, so that the awards are set properly, the scope and scale of the selection are appropriate, and the selection conditions and procedures are strict. No fees may be charged to those who participate in the evaluation and recognition activities, and may not be directly or disguised before and after the selection.Take a variety of related fees. Fourth, the Chamber of Commerce of the Industry Association should take the initiative to reduce the high fees. The Chamber of Commerce of Industry Associations should appropriately reduce the high membership fees and other charging standards and reduce the burden on enterprises. The Chamber of Commerce of Industry Associations should comprehensively sort out the charges of service projects and make them public. If it is included in the basic service project of the Chamber of Commerce of the Industry Association, no additional fees may be charged to the members. Cancellation of unreasonable charges and reduction of the fees for service items with higher surpluses shall not be disguised by means of compulsory donations or compulsory sponsorships, and the quality of services shall be effectively improved for the retained fees. Fifth, the Chamber of Commerce of Industry Associations should regulate the development of membership behavior. The Chamber of Commerce of Industry Associations must adhere to the principle of voluntary participation and freedom of resignation. It must not rely on government departments, use monopoly advantages and industry influence to force or disguise mandatory enrollment and hinder withdrawal. The Chamber of Commerce of Industry Associations should strengthen the classification and dynamic management of membership, optimize the membership structure, and further improve the pertinence and effectiveness of services. The Chamber of Commerce of National Industry Associations generally absorbs representative corporate members in the country. The Chamber of Commerce of provincial industry associations generally absorbs representative corporate members in the province.
 
Reporter: In the next step, what other measures does the Ministry of Civil Affairs have in regulating the fees charged by industry conferences?
 
A: The "Opinions" are important followers and rules for the management of fee collection in the industry conferences at present and in the future. With compliance and rules, the important thing is implementation. In accordance with the requirements of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, we will continue to do a good job in the management of the fees and charges of the trade associations involved in the trade associations, increase the intensity of law enforcement investigations, and find out the associations of industry associations that charge fees for violations of laws and regulations. Exposure together will effectively reduce the burden on enterprises and help China's economic and social development.

We will better promote the implementation of the rural minimum living security policy, and give better play to the role of rural minimum living security in winning the fight against poverty.
 
Regarding how to carry out the special management of rural subsistence allowances, Huang Shuxian proposed four key tasks at the meeting. The first is to seriously investigate and deal with corruption around the masses. To further broaden the channels for reflecting problems, local civil affairs departments at or above the county level shall publicize the social assistance complaints and report telephones to the public, and establish a clues for the people to report problems. For the clues of problems reflected by the masses, the county-level civil affairs departments should promptly report and hand over to the discipline inspection organs. It is necessary to combine the fight against evil and the fight against evil, and resolutely eliminate the illegal and illegal soils in rural areas. The second is to effectively improve the work style of the civil affairs system. It is necessary to strengthen case education and warning education, and guide grassroots civil cadres and low security operators to firmly establish a people-centered concept and resolutely curb the unhealthy trend in rural low-income service. The third is to firmly build the bottom line of the rural subsistence guarantee. It is necessary to work with the poverty alleviation department, and guide townships (streets) to investigate the poverty-stricken households that have not been included in the rural minimum living security, and find out the rural minimum security guarantee base. It is necessary to comprehensively check the rural minimum living security to prevent the occurrence of " leakage insurance " . The fourth is to establish a long-term mechanism for the management of rural minimum living security standards. To identify the risk points, weak points and supervision blind spots in the rural subsistence allowance service, formulate guidelines for the subsistence administrative documents, standardize the key aspects of the application for subsistence allowances, and extensively carry out " Internet + supervision " to improve the subsistence allowance work. transparency.
 
Huang Shuxian also stressed that the special management of rural subsistence allowances is an important part of the construction of the party's work style and clean government in the civil affairs system and will continue in the next three years. All localities should attach great importance to it, carefully arrange it, carefully deploy it, and study and formulate special governance implementation plans, define timetables and roadmaps, establish work accounts, and decompose tasks at different levels to ensure responsibility. The main leaders of civil affairs departments at all levels must shoulder the first responsibility, personally deploy, personally supervise and personally inspect; in charge of leadership as the direct responsible person, we must go deep into the front line to do a good job in supervising and implementing. It is necessary to establish a typical case notification exposure system, and form a shocking situation of corruption and style in rural low-income service. It is necessary to incorporate special governance work into the scope of assessment and evaluation of key tasks in civil affairs, and promote the in-depth development of special governance. It is necessary to pay attention to creating a good public opinion environment, adhere to the correct direction of public opinion, and do a good job in policy propaganda and interpretation.

How do you raise a lot? Taxation and medical care are combined into the main direction

People's Daily Online, Beijing, March 21 (Zhang Wenting) " Since China entered the aging society in 1999, the elderly population has increased by 110 million in 18 years. It is expected that by 2050, the number of elderly people in China will reach a peak of 487 million. It accounts for 34.9% of the total population. " The data from the National Committee on Aging indicates that China's aging has entered a stage of rapid development. How to improve the pension system and improve the aged care service has become an urgent issue.
 
In order to " have a good old age and have a doctor, " the government and all sectors of society are striving to find new directions. For example, this year's government work report mentioned that it will continue to raise pensions and promote the combination of health care and other ways of providing for the elderly. In addition, a tax-deferred pension insurance and long-term care insurance are also coming out, constantly enriching China's pension security level.
 
Tax deferred pension insurance to enrich the old-age security system
 
As we all know, China's current pension insurance system is a " three pillars " system. The  first pillar  means that the basic old-age insurance system undertaken at the national level has gradually matured; the  second pillar  is the enterprise annuity and occupational annuity undertaken by the enterprise, and the  third pillar  is the savings of individual investment. Endowment insurance and commercial endowment insurance, at present, the proportion of the latter two is still small, and the development is relatively lagging behind.
 
To this end, China has implemented a tax preferential policy for enterprise annuities and occupational annuities in 2014. Nowadays, the personal tax deferred pension insurance that has received much attention will also be introduced.
 
During the two sessions, Chen Wenhui and Huang Hongjun, vice-chairmen of the China Insurance Regulatory Commission, said that the pilot program for such insurance has been approved by the relevant departments and will be launched in the near future. This means that tax incentives will comprehensively cover the three pillars of China's pension insurance system.
 
The so-called tax deferred pension insurance refers to a kind of commercial pension insurance underwritten and operated by insurance companies and other institutions. Individuals can deduct the pre-tax salary within a certain amount of the premium payment, and pay the tax when they receive the insurance premium after retirement. This means that the insured can provide premiums before the tax, and can reduce the tax burden while also providing more protection for the elderly.
 
So what kind of people benefit the most? According to Sun Bosunbo, assistant secretary-general of the 50-member forum of the pension finance, tax incentives are divided into two modes: one is the quota system, that is, regardless of the income level, the amount of tax benefits is fixed every year, which is relatively more for the middle and low income groups. To be beneficial, for example, the monthly tax concession is up to 1,000 yuan, then the person with a monthly salary of 10,000 yuan is equivalent to 10% of the salary to enjoy tax benefits. A person with a income of 20,000 is equivalent to a 5% salary tax benefit.
 
The second is the proportional system. For example, if the participants' wages are 5%, they can enjoy tax benefits. Then, those with a monthly income of 20,000 can enjoy a tax benefit of 1,000 yuan, while those with a monthly income of 10,000 yuan enjoy a tax benefit of 500 yuan.
 
Generally speaking, foreign countries have adopted a quota system for preferential taxation. In this regard, Sun Bo suggested that China can also adopt the quota system.
 
According to Li Yanhua, executive vice president of Taikang Insurance Group and chairman of Taikang Pension, there is a huge market for tax deferred pension insurance. Pension insurance in developed countries such as Britain and the United States accounts for more than 35% of personal insurance premiums. The pension insurance for pensions accounts for only 4.4% of the personal insurance premium income, which means that the development of such insurance in China is very broad.
 
For the tax-deferred pension insurance products to be launched, Li Yanhua said that the design of products should ultimately be judged from the nature of pension insurance, and the benefits of products and the security of account funds should be the core.
 
Medical care combined with a sound old-age service system
 
Faced with the trend of population aging, an important part of establishing a multi-level old-age security system is a sound old-age service and a comprehensive old-age security system.
 
According to statistics, in 2017, the number of disabled and half-disabled elderly in China has exceeded 40 million. A very large elderly group needs a combination of medical care and services. According to Huang Shuxian, Minister of Civil Affairs, the current medical service system cannot fully accept these elderly people. The daily care, chronic disease management, health education and other services that the elderly are most concerned about are still lacking.
 
Especially for the  empty nest elderly  whose children are not around , home-based pensions can no longer meet their medical and pension needs, and more and more elderly people are willing to choose an old-age care institution that can provide medical services.
 
This year's government work report clearly stated that we must continue to promote the combination of medical care. Zheng Bingwen, director of the World Social Security Research Center of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said: "The combination of medical care and maintenance is an inevitable trend in the development of old-age care. The older the elderly, the more they need to be medically combined. "
 
According to his analysis, the most important combination of medical and nursing care is institutional pension, followed by community pension, and once again home-based care. Most of the institutional pensions are market-oriented and commoditized. It is necessary to provide quality services to attract customers, and naturally bring medical care.
 
At present, the pension model represented by Taikang Home has emerged in China, and the medical and rehabilitation functions have been introduced into the old-age community to solve the difficulty that the medical structure cannot support the elderly and the old-age institutions cannot see the disease  .
 
According to Liu Tingjun, vice president of Taikang Insurance Group and CEO of Taikang Jiantou, the combination of medical care and nutrition is not simply a combination of medical and old-age care, but the need to move doctors from simple specialists to general practitioners, especially to the elderly. The general practitioners are making changes. At the same time, the hospital's medical model should be changed from treating patients to becoming a family doctor model based on long-term follow-up and active maintenance. "
 
It is understood that there are still some problems in the current medical care combined services, such as the contradiction between large demand and insufficient effective supply; the potential of the medical care market is contradictory to the lack of social investment power; the supply of integrated medical care in the community is insufficient.
 
In this regard, Zheng Bingwen mentioned that at present, institutional pensions still need to deepen supply-side structural reforms. The vast majority of ordinary people need a close-knit, general-age nursing home. The nursing home needs to be diversified in the supply side, which is suitable for the multi-level needs of the entire market. In addition, we must improve the market environment and market mechanisms to attract more private capital to enter and form an effective competitive market. 

Play a policy role
 
The civil affairs department shoulders the responsibility of caring for the protection of left-behind children and left-behind elderly people. According to Huang Shuxian, Minister of Civil Affairs, the current rural minimum living standards in all counties (cities, districts) in the country have reached or exceeded the national poverty alleviation standards. The national average urban and rural minimum living standards have increased by 9.4% and 14.9% respectively over the previous year.
 
Last year, the Ministry of Civil Affairs greatly improved the central subsidy standards for disaster relief, emergency assistance, rehabilitation and reconstruction of civilian housing, and the relief of family members of victims of disasters. The national emergency response was launched 17 times to help local emergency resettlement more than 5 million. People, the implementation of winter and spring rescue more than 51 million people. The two subsidy systems for the disabled have been fully implemented, benefiting more than 10 million disabled people respectively. The special action of the left-behind children in rural areas to " joint monitoring and accompanying growth " was solidly promoted, helping 760,000 unguarded rural left-behind children to implement custody measures, 180,000 non-registered rural left-behind children registered and settled, and 16,000 unemployed rural left-behind children returning Return to school. The national rescue and care institutions were comprehensively inspected and rectified, and the special action of  warm winter and warmth  was implemented. More than 3 million vagrants and beggars were rescued throughout the year.
 
Increase home care services
 
The data shows that there are currently 241 million elderly people aged 60 and over in China. At the same time, the contradiction between supply and demand of aged care services is particularly prominent.
 
Gao Xiaobing, deputy minister of the Ministry of Civil Affairs, said that in 2017, the Ministry of Civil Affairs conducted a network-based investigation of more than 41,700 nursing homes across the country. After a year of rectification, the number of security problems in nursing homes has dropped by 24.9%, and the provision of aged care services has been further enriched. The quality of nursing staff has been greatly improved.
 
Gao Xiaobing said that China now needs special home care services because most Chinese elderly people are willing to support their families at home.  Home-based pensions need support from the community.  Gao Xiaobing said that the Ministry of Civil Affairs should cooperate with the overall arrangement of the Ministry of Finance to further improve relevant measures and attract more social capital to support the elderly.
 
Responding to more than 40,000 people involved in snow and ice disasters
 
Recently, a large-scale low-temperature freezing and snowstorm has occurred throughout the country, and the resettlement of the affected people has become the most concerned issue at present.

There were 16 provinces, and nearly 90 cities and autonomous prefectures suffered disasters. More than 4,200,000 square kilometers, more than 150,000 people affected by the disaster, the impact is rare in history. During this period, the Ministry of Civil Affairs urgently allocated more than 140,000 cotton quilts and distributed them to the affected people, and urgently transferred more than 40,000 people.
 
In order to effectively deal with major natural disasters, last year the National Disaster Reduction Committee and the Ministry of Civil Affairs launched an emergency response 17 times and sent 17 disaster relief working groups to guide the local authorities in disaster relief work. Gu Chaoyu said that after entering the winter, the Spring Festival is coming soon. The issue of life security during this time is the focus of current work.
 
" This year, the central government's natural disaster living subsidy standard has been greatly improved. This is the concern of the Party Central Committee and the State Council for the affected areas and the affected people. This warmth must be really in the hands of the masses. The main work we will do next is Do a good job of implementation. " Gu Chaoyu said.
 
Increase the placement of retired soldiers
 
Gao Xiaobing said that the Ministry of Civil Affairs has reorganized all the information on retired soldiers who have met the working conditions of the government since 1978. After combing out, according to the existing policies, one-to-one correspondence, all those that have not been implemented are resolutely required to implement. In the past, the placement of retired soldiers by state-owned enterprises was the main channel. After the reform and opening up, there were fewer and fewer state-owned enterprises in the prefecture-level cities, and the resettlement capacity was getting smaller and smaller.
 
In the next step, the Ministry of Civil Affairs will continue to improve rigid measures and increase the implementation of existing policies. It is mainly to study the connection of relevant policies and increase the provision of resettlement posts. " We will take corresponding measures, such as continuing to coordinate the central enterprises to implement the proportion of 5% of newly added personnel for the retired soldiers to resettle, and guide the qualified places to continue to take out administrative posts and career posts to resettle the retired soldiers. At the same time, they will also consider Policy research on other special placement targets, including retired soldiers, to improve policy coverage and execution. " Gao Xiaobing said.

Wind and clean government construction and anti-corruption work.
 
Question and answer record:
 
People's Daily Online Reporter:
 
Minister Huang mentioned that the party is strictly governed. My problem is that in the face of the fact that the former party of the Ministry of Civil Affairs is in charge of the party, the party is " wide, loose, soft " and there has been a problem of systematic corruption. What measures have been specifically introduced by the new party group? To strengthen the implementation of the requirements of comprehensively and strictly administering the party. Thank you.
 
Huang Shuxian:
 
As we all know, the original party group of the Ministry of Civil Affairs was " wide, loose, and soft " in governing the party and the party , and there was a systemic corruption problem. The Party Central Committee named the main responsible person of the original party group of the Ministry of Civil Affairs, and also named other responsible persons, and made a briefing. Our new party group faces such a situation and faces the task of heavy civil reform and development. The two are closely related. To complete the heavy tasks of civil affairs reform and development, we must comprehensively and strictly manage the party, have strong and strong party leadership, and build political support for party building. In accordance with the requirements of the Central Committee, our new party group resolutely implements the relevant decisions made by the Party Central Committee, unswervingly promotes the comprehensive implementation of the party in the Ministry of Civil Affairs and the civil affairs system, comprehensively strengthens the party building of the organs, and promotes the party style in a solid manner. Integrity building and anti-corruption work. In the past year, we have mainly focused on the following aspects:
 
The first is to unify thinking and raise awareness. Earnestly study and implement the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the 18th CPC Central Committee, the spirit of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, seriously strengthen the political life within the party, improve the political position of party members and cadres, comprehensively enhance the " four consciousnesses " , and strengthen the " four self-confidences " and resolutely Implementing the Party Central Committee's decision on the accountability of the main party leaders and relevant responsible persons of the Ministry of Civil Affairs, the unity of the party members and cadres of our organs and units is truly unified to the requirements of strictly administering the party and united to the spirit of the Party Central Committee. Over the past year, through the joint efforts of all of us, we have reached a consensus in this regard. We have formed consensus and improved our understanding in the organs and systems.
 
The second is to improve institutional measures. Formulate and improve the list of the party's main party responsibility, the working rules of the party building leading group, the implementation of accountability, and the implementation of the eight provisions of the central government. A method of in-house inspections was launched to conduct the first round of internal inspections. In addition, we improved the system of party group central group study and the selection and appointment of government cadres, adjusted and enriched the party building work leading group, optimized the institutional setup of the party committees under the direct organs, and strengthened the system and organizational guarantees in accordance with the requirements of comprehensively administering the party strictly.
 
The third is to implement the main responsibility. Clarify the main responsibility of the party secretary and the leadership responsibility of the party members. According to the deployment of the CPC Central Committee, the full responsibility of the party strictly compacted Party Group, directly under the Party committee, various grassroots Party committees and Party branch branch members and leading cadres at all levels, so that " at every level, layers " Implementation " to comprehensively strengthen the party's leadership over all work.
 
The fourth is to pay close attention to the inspection and rectification. The weak situation in which we manage the party's party is the problem found in the central inspection, and we are required to rectify it. Therefore, last year we seized the central inspection and pointed out the problem of centralized rectification. Resolutely support and cooperate with relevant central departments to investigate and deal with the problems of the comrades in charge of the original party group, resolutely implement the decision of the Party Central Committee to handle the relevant personnel, thoroughly find out and resolve the problems existing in the leadership of the Ministry, resolutely rectify and implement the Party Central Committee's decision-making deployment, and the authorities The weak construction of the party, the lax management of social organizations, the ineffective supervision of public institutions, and the lack of standardization in the selection and appointment of cadres have achieved remarkable results in the inspection and rectification, and promoted the strict management of the party by the organs and subordinate units.
 
Fifth, we will unswervingly promote the work of building a clean and honest government and anti-corruption work. Strictly implement the responsibility system for party style and clean government construction, consistently implement the spirit of the eight central regulations, resolutely prevent the " four winds " from rebounding, and seriously investigate and deal with violations of laws and regulations that occur in government agencies. Our party group strictly abides by the various systems and regulations and sets an example to play a model role. Through this year's efforts, the Ministry of Civil Affairs has significantly improved the ideological understanding of the party, and the appearance of the cadre team has changed significantly. The political ecology of good and clean and the atmosphere of good entrepreneurship have accelerated.
 
However, we also know deeply that the task of strictly administering the party in an all-round way is arduous and arduous, and always on the road. The party group of the Ministry of Civil Affairs will continue to promote the comprehensive and strict development of the party and provide a strong political guarantee for the reform and development of the civil affairs in the new era. Thank you.

Play, make precise decisions , and constantly win new victories. " The 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China adheres to the people-centered development thinking and makes important arrangements and arrangements for resolutely laying a good fight against poverty. Civil affairs work is related to the basic livelihood security. It plays an important role in poverty alleviation. It must be deployed in accordance with the important decisions of the 19th National Congress, accurately locate, grasp the key, and implement it.
 
First, fully understand the important role of the bottom guarantee in poverty alleviation
 
It is an important mission of our party to eliminate poverty, improve people's livelihood and achieve common prosperity. To implement the spirit of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China requires us to fully understand the important position and role of the bottom-line protection in tackling poverty and tackling the difficulties. We must pay close attention to the policy shortcomings, earnestly increase financial input, and continuously improve the ability of the bottom and bottom.
 
The bottom line guarantee is the bottom line system arrangement for building a well-off society in an all-round way. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core has adhered to the basic strategy of precision poverty alleviation and poverty alleviation, and made a series of major decision-making arrangements for the protection of the bottom. 2015, Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Guizhou first proposed when the research " catch-all group of guaranteeing policy " requirement; in the central work conference on poverty alleviation and development, re-emphasized " social security number reveal all the details " , requiring incapacity for complete or partial The poor population plays a role in the subsistence allowance. The general secretary stressed: " To build a well-off society in an all-round way, one must not be less; on the road of common prosperity, one cannot fall behind . " This means that we must fully build a well-off society that must benefit all the people. Every poor person cannot fall behind on a well-off road. For those who have the ability to develop, we must adopt developmental poverty alleviation measures to achieve poverty alleviation through  hematopoietic  . For those who have full or partial loss of their ability to work, they must adopt the basic guarantee measures such as rural minimum living security to maintain their basic life through  blood transfusion  .
 
The bottom of the guarantee is the last resort to resolutely win the fight against poverty. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Chinas work in getting rid of poverty has made great achievements that have attracted worldwide attention. 2013 - 2016, the country's rural poor with an average annual reduction of 1391 million people out of poverty relief work of big, wide scale, the effect of, unprecedented. The developmental poverty alleviation policy is mainly aimed at the poor people with working ability. As this part of the population gradually gets rid of poverty, its policy marginal effect gradually decreases. The remaining part is not quite out of poverty population partially or completely incapacitated particular the poor, and only through policies to safeguard to reveal all the details, in order to ensure win tough fight poverty.
 
Bottom protection is a necessary measure to solve the problem of deep poverty. At present, poverty alleviation has entered a critical period of attacking the city and pulling the village. Deep poverty-stricken areas and deep-poor people have become the " most difficult bones " . General Secretary Xi pointed out that, at the population distribution, mainly the disabled, elderly, chronically ill and other " unemployed can help, unable poverty " lower part of the education of the poor and literacy levels, lack of skills of the poor masses. It is characterized by the task of poverty alleviation for the poverty-stricken population and the poverty alleviation of poverty-stricken people. For these special groups, only the rural subsistence allowances and other policy-based protection and charity measures can be used to solve their special difficulties. Only three years have passed since the fight against poverty. It has become the top priority of the current work to help these special people get rid of poverty.
 
2. Positive results in the field of social security
 
The civil affairs work bears an important role in protecting the poor in the fight against poverty: first, the bottom line of the basic life of the hard-working people; second, strengthening the special care of left-behind children and left-behind elderly people; and the third is to encourage social forces to participate in poverty alleviation. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the civil affairs departments at all levels have followed the work plan of " holding the bottom line, highlighting key points, perfecting the system, and guiding expectations " in accordance with the major decision-making arrangements of the central government , and earnestly promoted the implementation of the social security field and achieved positive results.
 
First, the institutional system is constantly improving. We have improved and improved the rural low-income system, defined the key tasks and work requirements for the effective connection between rural low-income and poverty alleviation, and refined the subsidies for poor people such as rural archives to participate in basic medical insurance and related medical assistance policies. The policies for care and protection of left-behind children in rural areas, the protection of children in distress, social assistance for the disabled, and other policies have been introduced, and the living allowance for disabled persons and the subsidy system for severely disabled persons have been implemented.
 
Second, the level of protection at the bottom of the pocket is constantly improving. As of the end of November 2017, the rural minimum living standards of all counties (cities, districts, and flags) in the country have met or exceeded the national poverty alleviation standards. All localities implement the classified insurance policy in a comprehensive manner, and appropriately increase the minimum guarantee for those with special difficulties such as the disabled and the elderly who still have difficulty in living after the minimum living allowance. January 2017 - November, the total fiscal expenditure of urban and rural subsistence allowances and other social assistance funds at all levels of 199.13 billion yuan, compared with 16.24 billion yuan a year earlier and more spending.
 
Third, the special population care and protection work progressed steadily. Among the 769,000 left-behind children in the country, 89.5% have implemented guardianship duties, registered to settle 125,000, and 12,000 returned to school. The country has initially formed a rural old-age service supply pattern based on family support, old-age care institutions and mutual help happiness homes, rural elderly associations, and township nursing homes. There are 35,000 community-based old-age care institutions and facilities, 76,000 community-supported old-age facilities, and more than 20,000 rural nursing homes.
 
Fourth, the participation of social forces in poverty alleviation is in the ascendant. We will study and formulate policies and measures to support the participation of social organizations and social workers in poverty alleviation, and guide the mobilization of social organizations and professional workers to play a role in poverty alleviation. Encourage national social organizations to participate in poverty alleviation work in areas such as aid-aid Tibet and Luojingshan districts, and collect a large amount of funds and materials to carry out major illness relief, child care, and assistance for the disabled.
 
Third, thoroughly implement the spirit of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, and solidly promote the protection of the civil affairs field
 
The 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China proposes that safeguarding and improving people's livelihood must grasp the most direct and most realistic interests of the people and constantly meet the people's growing needs for a better life. The entire national political system should earnestly enhance the sense of responsibility, mission, and urgency, further expand the train of thought, innovate the means, take multiple measures, take the initiative, and push forward the poverty alleviation to ensure that all tasks are implemented.
 
First, further improve the social assistance. To do a good job in securing the bottom, we must work hard to coordinate the urban and rural social assistance system and improve the minimum living security system. We will improve and give full play to the role of the coordination mechanism for life support work for people at the county level, and will not allow the people in difficulty to  leave rescue  . We will improve the minimum living security system, improve the methods for identifying subsistence allowances, and scientifically determine and dynamically adjust rural subsistence allowances according to national poverty alleviation standards. Continue to improve the medical assistance system and strive to alleviate the problem of poverty alleviation due to illness. Further improve the emergency response mechanism for disaster relief, and strengthen disaster prevention, disaster reduction, disaster relief, and post-disaster recovery and reconstruction. It is necessary to focus on deep poverty-stricken areas and study and formulate more targeted measures to effectively solve the special difficulties of the  triple  population.
 
The second is to improve the social welfare system and improve the caring service system for left-behind children and the elderly. Solidly carry out the " Combined Guardianship, Companion Growth " care and protection campaign, strengthen the basic information dynamic management of rural left-behind children and children in need, improve the rescue and protection mechanism, and improve the care service system. Establish contact and regular visitation systems, explore the establishment of a list of care services, promote mutual assistance and volunteer services, and ensure that left-behind elderly people receive basic care. Actively develop the cause of the disabled, increase the investment of disabled people and public services, and improve the level of rehabilitation services for the disabled.
 
The third is to further mobilize social forces to participate in poverty alleviation. Accelerate the implementation of social work professionals to serve remote and poverty-stricken areas. Promote the development of philanthropy, gather more charitable resources for poverty alleviation; widely mobilize social organizations to participate in poverty alleviation, and guide volunteers and volunteer service organizations to carry out voluntary service activities around poverty alleviation. Actively fulfill the responsibilities of the leading units in the Luojingshan area to help the poor, and fully promote the poverty alleviation and targeted poverty alleviation work in the district.
 
The fourth is to further strengthen the construction of the rural governance system. Under the leadership of grassroots party organizations, we will guide poor areas to select and match the cadres of the village committees according to law, gradually improve the ability of village committee cadres to handle affairs according to law, and unite and lead the villagers to actively participate in poverty alleviation. We will improve the community consultation and democratic supervision mechanism for poor villages, and organize villagers to carry out consultation activities around poverty alleviation.
 
The fifth is to further study and solve the new situation and new problems in the protection of the bottom. With the advancement of poverty alleviation, new situations and new problems in the protection of the bottom will continue to emerge. We must thoroughly study and implement the spirit of the 19th Party Congress and further raise awareness, unify our thinking, master methods, and improve our work. It is necessary to strengthen investigation and research, and timely analyze the problems of research and judgment. It is necessary to use innovative ideas, innovative thinking and innovative methods to explore and solve problems such as new poverty, relative poverty, poverty alleviation and poverty alleviation, earnestly guarantee the bottom of the road, consolidate the achievements of poverty alleviation, and lay a solid foundation for building a well-off society in an all-round way.

Xiao Yaqing, director of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission
 
Which ministers most often " face " in front of the media ?
 
On November 17, Xiao Yaqing, director of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council, accepted the manuscript of the exclusive interview of the Peoples Daily reporter and published the  Voice of Ministers  column on the morning .

In February 2016, Xiao Yaqing went to the position of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council. He has rich experience in management of central enterprises and has been hailed by the media as the representative of the new state-owned enterprise leader  .
 
Since the beginning of this year, Xiao Yaqing has answered questions from reporters on the progress of central enterprise debt-to-equity swaps, the participation of central enterprises in the construction of the  Belt and Road  and the achievements of state-owned enterprises in the press conferences of the National Peoples Congress and the  Ministerial Channel  and the press conference of the State Council .

In addition, some ministers responded to outside doubts by accepting media interviews or writing in the media. For example, in July, the Minister of Justice Zhang Jun pointed out that in an exclusive interview with Xinhua News Agency reporters, the reform of the notarization institution  does not change, and it will not work if it is late  . The judicial administrative department is duty-bound.

In the face of social hotspots, the ministers " tell the truth and pay the truth "
 
As the  first spokesperson  of the department , the minister must not only talk about achievements, but also be good at responding to social hotspots. This year, in the face of reporters questioning of relevant issues, many ministers responded swiftly and responded calmly, in accordance with the requirements of the Prime Minister,  telling the truth and making a solid conclusion  .
 
For the so-called " foreign withdrawal " , the then Minister of Commerce Gao Hucheng pointed out this year that this statement is biased.  I have seen that some products have actually been transferred out in recent years, but at the same time, many high-end industries have gathered in the Chinese market. I think this is the result of the market playing a decisive role in resource allocation. 
 
" Financial subsidy funds are not ' Tang Yu meat ' . " Minister of Finance Xiao Jie said this year when he commented on the phenomenon of fraudulent compensation for new energy vehicles. The Ministry of Finance attaches great importance to the problem of fraudulent compensation and has already recovered the funds and fines of about 2.3 billion yuan. At present, relevant enterprises are taking measures to seriously rectify.
 
Regarding how to reduce the " campus bullying " incident, Minister of Education Chen Baosheng pointed out during the two sessions this year that to solve the " campus bullying ", it is necessary to establish a legislative thinking and to do so by law. Only in this way can we achieve social consensus.
 
On the same occasion, Chen Baosheng also answered questions on how to put an end to the " toxic runway " on campus . He said that in the future, the runway and similar facilities will be better built on the construction process, and who will win the bidding. After the completion of the construction, " turnkey " , "the school will not engage, please ask the professional force to do it . "
 
For the issue of telecom fraud, Miao Wei, the minister of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, said this year that his mobile phone often receives fraudulent text messages and telephone calls. He took the initiative to mention the " Xu Yuyu Incident " that occurred last year , and revealed that this year it will establish an interception system covering all provinces and cities.
 
" Must be vigilant, a dream come true is this kind of thing rarely happens, do not rely on information issued by these crooks. And what a great prize, what it wants you to play money, or to increase our vigilance, so Criminals are not easy to succeed. " Nursery reminded.
 
Minister of Agriculture Han Changfu said that when we talked about genetic modification, we are now focusing on the development and commercialization of non-food crops. At present, China has not approved any commercial cultivation of genetically modified food crops.
 
In February 2016, the "Opinions on Comprehensively Promoting the Openness of Government Affairs" issued by the State Council of China stated that the principal responsible persons should take the lead in accepting media interviews, show their attitude and position, and issue an authoritative voice as a " first spokesperson " . The  Regulations  announced in November further require that the main person in charge of the department be the  first interpreter and responsible person  . They should dare to take the lead and interpret through various ways such as speaking, writing articles, accepting interviews, and attending conferences. Policy, passing authoritative information.
 
In May of this year, the evaluation and assessment of the press release work issued by the State Council for the first time showed that the main voice of the department has become a " new normal " , but at the same time, it is pointed out that the face-to-face interaction between the top leaders and the media reporters is still relatively small.
 
A very important sign of the modern government is to respond promptly to the expectations and concerns of the people. With the further development of the concept of open government affairs and the gradual development of assessment and assessment work, how can the  ministers  better serve as  first spokesperson  and  first interpreter and responsible person  in the new year? It is worth waiting to see. .

This figure is also increasing year by year. This year, we have also substantially increased the subsidy standards for emergency relief for major natural disasters, rescue during the transition period, and the restoration of the central government due to disasters, and have greatly increased, and some have doubled.
 
The third is to constantly standardize the rescue and security management work, and carry out information comparison with the relevant departments on household registration vehicles, bank deposits, securities property, housing security, etc., to improve the accuracy of the identification of rescue objects, to achieve accurate assistance, and to ensure the best. In the streets and towns, a window of acceptance has been established to facilitate the work of the people in difficulty. Strengthen the performance appraisal of social assistance, fund supervision and supervision and inspection, and seriously investigate and punish violations of laws and regulations that harm the legitimate rights and interests of the masses, especially those in need, and ensure the fairness and justice of the rescue work. Next, we will conscientiously implement the Party's fine nineteen great God, in accordance with the requirements of the CPC Central Committee on their bottom line, focus, improve the system, guiding expected to continue to improve the system, strengthen management, improve the level to work on better Do a good job of social assistance and poverty alleviation, and ensure the basic life of the people in need.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 1st: The multi-pronged measures and the precise measures to win the fight against poverty - the National People's Congress Standing Committee on the topic of poverty alleviation work
 
Xinhua News Agency reporter Hu Wei, Hou Xuejing
 
The 29th meeting of the Standing Committee of the 12th National People's Congress held a joint meeting in the Golden Hall of the Great Hall of the People, and conducted a special inquiry in conjunction with the State Council's report on poverty alleviation.
 
" Cultivating leading industries in poor areas, increase the degree of organization and collective growth of the economy, what specific measures have? '" The implementation of the rural poor a serious illness, chronic, endemic Medicaid policy considerations What? " Thematic inquiry to the point, The responsible person of the relevant department of the State Council answered the question.
 
(Subheading) Take precise measures to ensure that the industry's poverty alleviation is effective
 
Guo Gengmao, deputy director of the NPC Agriculture and Rural Committee, asked: Industrial poverty alleviation is the fundamental strategy for poverty alleviation. However, in some places, the selection of projects in industrial development is not the same, the degree of organization is not high, and there is certain market risk. At the same time, the majority of poor villages in the country have very little collective economic income, which is difficult to drive the people out of poverty and become rich. What specific measures are in cultivating leading industries in poverty-stricken areas, improving the degree of organization and strengthening the collective economy?
 
Minister of Agriculture Han Changfu said that although the joint efforts of the industry have made positive progress in industrial poverty alleviation, more and more poor people are realizing poverty alleviation through industrial development, but at the same time some poverty-stricken areas do have homogenization in industrial development. The problems of production and sales are out of touch, the leading enterprises are weak in driving ability, and the poor households are not connected closely.
 
Han Changfu said that the next step of the Ministry of Agriculture will guide poor areas to cultivate differentiated comparative advantages, create regional public brands, produce marketable agricultural products, avoid homogenous competition, and help broaden sales channels, especially to promote wholesale markets, dealers, and large supermarkets. Establish long-term and stable production and sales relations with poor counties and villages. It will also speed up the cultivation of large-scale breeding households, family farms, and farmer cooperatives, help introduce leading enterprises that can drive poor households, and focus on the development of characteristic industries in poverty-stricken areas, and strengthen key and common technology research and development, especially for the selection of local contiguous areas. Variety and technology, carry out technical training that is easy to learn, easy to understand and easy to use. It will also cooperate with the Ministry of Finance and other departments to promote the cooperation model of shareholding cooperation, order assistance, production custody, etc., to guide local governments to change the simple way of helping to send money and materials, to quantify the financial subsidy funds to poor households, and to make poverty Households can share dividends during development.
 
For the vast majority of poor villages, there is a lack of collective economic income. Han Changfu believes that this is a universal problem and a problem. The Ministry of Agriculture is considering the next step to explore solutions from four aspects and gradually expand the collective economy of poor villages. First, support and encourage the use of resources such as collective  four wastes  and orchards that are not contracted to the poor , and concentrate on development or develop agricultural projects through public bidding. The second is to encourage poor areas to use recreational resources such as ecological environment and human history to develop leisure agriculture and rural tourism. The third is to encourage the poverty-stricken areas to use the idle various types of real estate facilities and collective construction land under the premise of meeting the plan, and develop the corresponding industries by means of independent development, joint venture and cooperation. Fourth, support the encouragement of poor villages to use collective housing, government assistance funds, social funds, etc., to develop the collective economy through shareholding or participation in leading agricultural industrialization enterprises, village enterprises and joint construction.
 
(Subheading) Further improve the medical security level of the rural poor
 
In rural areas, major diseases, chronic diseases and endemic diseases are the main causes of poverty and poverty. " What are the considerations for implementing the policy of medical treatment for major diseases, chronic diseases and endemic diseases of the rural poor? " The question raised by Tang Shili, member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, resonated with the on-site personnel.
 
Li Bin, director of the National Health and Family Planning Commission, explained that the current three lines of basic medical insurance, such as new rural cooperative medical insurance, major illness insurance, and medical assistance, have achieved full coverage of the rural poor and have implemented a tilt policy. Among them, the new rural cooperatives' reimbursement rate for the poorly reimbursed in hospitals increased by 5 percentage points, and the major illness insurance tilted the poor population on the deductible line, the reimbursement ratio, and the reimbursement capping line. On the basis of the three guarantee lines, the special poverty-stricken families and populations will be promoted to establish a medical insurance system, and supplementary insurance, financial subsidies and social assistance will be used to ensure the out-of-pocket ratio of poor patients. The poor are paid for in the county after hospitalization. In the window of the hospital, one-stop settlement is implemented. After the discharge, only the part that they have to deal with is handed over. Others are settled by the hospital and the security institution, effectively reducing their burden.
 
In this regard, the Minister of Civil Affairs Huang Shuxian added that the current target of assistance, including the poorest and the poor, and other poor people, the proportion of assistance within the scope of the policy has generally reached 70%. The country has 93% of the region to establish a one-stop real-time settlement mechanism, where poor people are hospitalized for treatment basically implemented " with the rule knot, with the knot-go " .
 
(Subheading) Studying the establishment of ecological compensation to promote poverty alleviation
 
At present, there are many key ecological function areas in China, many of which are in minority areas. How to deal with the relationship between ecological protection and economic development and poverty alleviation and development is of great significance to ethnic areas and is not difficult. Wu Shimin, deputy director of the National People's Congress National Committee, asked questions about the effective measures the country will take in handling the protection and development of ethnic minority areas so that farmers and herders in these areas can receive the compensation they deserve and enhance their sense of gain. A win-win situation for protection and development?
 
Any of the leaders of the National Development and Reform Commission responded that some poor areas in ethnic minorities have a poor living environment, a fragile ecological environment, and a relatively high proportion of poor farmers and herdsmen. The tasks of ecological environmental protection and poverty alleviation are heavy. To this end, the State Council Leading Group for Poverty Alleviation has combined poverty alleviation with ecological protection as an important part of the  five batches  project. The National Development and Reform Commission and other relevant departments have also combined efforts to promote ecological construction and ecological compensation, and continuously increase support for ecological poverty alleviation. For example, in the construction of major ecological projects such as returning farmland to forests and grasslands, protection of natural forest resources, construction of key shelter forest systems, and comprehensive control of rocky desertification, priority is given to prioritizing poverty-stricken area construction indicators and investment, and more than 80% of farmland is required.

The couple just completed the 300th flight between the two sides.
 
Tasting the taste of cross-strait " love and family " , Wang Xiaofei is willing to "make the media " : In recent years, he sent Taiwanese employees to the mainland for internships, and also brought Taiwanese friends to visit the mainland, which led to several pairs of " cross-strait couples . "  Most of the Beijing boys have married Taiwanese girls,  he said.
 
As an important part of the 9th Straits Forum, the Cross-Strait Marriage and Family Forum was held in Xiamen from the 17th to the 19th. Wang Fei and large S on behalf of the couple as the two sides ' own experiences " .
 
At the opening ceremony of the Cross-Strait Marriage and Family Forum on the afternoon of the 18th, the Minister of Civil Affairs Huang Shuxian said that since the resumption of non-governmental exchanges between the two sides in 1987, cross-strait marriage and family have gone through 30 years of hard work. There are currently 378,000 pairs of spouses on both sides of the strait. Forum information shows that the number of cross-strait marriages is growing at a rate of about 10,000 pairs per year.
 
Zhan Xiuying, chairman of Taiwans  China-China Cross-Straits Association  , said that todays cross-strait marriages are younger, overseas, and they are married, because of work, and because of network exchanges.
 
Although mainland spouses are still subject to discrimination, identity and work rights in Taiwan, the trend of cross-strait marriage development continues to move forward. Zhang Zhengzhong, chairman of Taiwan's " China Rescue Association ", summarized the development characteristics of cross-strait marriage in the past 30 years, and believed that " the conditions of cross-strait marriage spouses are more and more matched, and the quality of marriage is gradually stable and improved. "
 
This also affects the choice of the next generation on both sides of the strait. Taiwan's Ming Chuan University student leaves ? said at the forum, was born in Taiwan, she is a very long period of time ashamed to tell friends in Taiwan, her mother from Shanghai. However, in the past few years, cross-strait marriage has gradually increased, and it has given people a positive impression, making her  very proud mother from a developed city in the mainland  .
 
Over the past 30 years, the number of people on both sides of the strait has reached 117 million, and nearly 50,000 Taiwanese students have studied in the mainland. Many of them have been employed in the mainland. All of this has made many couples on both sides of the strait.
 
On the 17th, the " cross-strait beautiful newcomer collective wedding " , hundreds of new people on both sides of the strait dressed in red traditional costumes, shared the wedding customs of southern Fujian, read the wedding vows. Their marriage and love stories reflect the new characteristics of the " sweet cause " on both sides of the strait .
 
Some of them have become attached to their studies. Taiwan Taoyuan guy Zhao Yujie and Chengdu girl Gu Yue are classmates of Renmin University of China 2012. After graduating last year, Zhao Yujie chose to go to Peking University to continue studying for graduate studies. Gu Yue entered a media job. This couple of campus couples recently completed a positive result. The groom plans to stay in Beijing after graduating from graduate school because of the  more dynamic and competitive environment  .
 
Some of them are at work. Xia Xiangguang, a young man from Shandong, sold the company's products to Kaohsiung girl He Yanping in Shanghai. The business was not made, and the two young people were getting closer. They sold a Taiwanese product to Hangzhou in 2013, and now they have opened 10 stores and bought a house in Hangzhou. "The heart has settled down, " said the bride He Yanping.
 
The stories of marriage and love between the two sides are colorful. Yan Yi, a girl from Yilan, Taiwan, and Han Bin from Fuzhou, saw a sensation in the blind date and talked for hours at a meeting. Taiwanese girl Pan Meijun was attracted by the voice of Hunan guy Jiang Zairun on the karaoke social software. After the online love, she stepped into the marriage hall.
 
In the " post-80s " young man Qiu Shijie in Taiwan , the shallow strait does not constitute a marriage barrier for young people on both sides of the strait, but instead prompts everyone to understand the city where the other party is located.
 
At first, still in college he took to the streets in support of Taiwan's mainland spouses rallying cry, that is " other people's things ," to make moral, did not expect that one day, they will fall in love with the girl Zhangzhou, the " mainland spouses " become Becoming your own business.
 
" We are going back and forth between the two sides of the strait, and life is full of freshness. What is even more wonderful is the constant discovery of the common sense between the two sides of the strait. " Qiu Shijie said that his wife is a southern Fujianese who is very suitable for Taiwan's food, clothing, housing and transportation. He also obtained a doctorate from Taiwan University. After graduation, I went to the mainland to find a teaching position and settle down.
 
" The importance attached by the Straits Forum to cross-strait marriage issues shows that the mainland has always attached importance to promoting cross-strait civil exchanges and exchanges. " Xiong Tianping, the husband of Beijing singer Yang Yang and Taiwanese artist, said that he hopes that the two sides will develop peacefully and create a better future for the cross-strait marriage and family. (Participating in writing: Gao Xue) (End)

Recently, the General Office of the CPC Central Committee and the General Office of the State Council issued the "Opinions on Strengthening the Service Capacity Building of Township Governments." The "Opinions" scientifically summarizes the practical experience of promoting township reform and development in recent years, and clearly proposes new goals, new tasks, and new requirements for strengthening the service capacity building of township governments, strengthening the construction of township governments for the current and future period, and promoting grassroots governance systems and Modernization of governance capabilities provides important follow-up.
 
Deeply understand the significance of the promulgation of the "Opinions"
 
The "Opinions" fully embodies the great importance and deployment requirements of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core to the construction of township governments. It is of great significance for consolidating the party's ruling foundation, promoting sustained and healthy economic development and social harmony and stability.
 
This is an important measure to thoroughly implement the decision-making and deployment of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the Party Central Committee and the State Council have made a series of important arrangements for deepening the reform of the administrative system, transforming government functions, strengthening the service capacity building of grassroots government, and building a service-oriented government that the people are satisfied with. General Secretary Xi Jinping attaches great importance to the work of townships and towns, and has repeatedly conducted in-depth research in townships and towns, requiring townships and towns to do a good job in serving the people, and to improve the work and improve the service level based on the satisfaction of the people. We must profoundly understand the importance and urgency of strengthening the service capacity building of township governments, and promote the service capacity building of township governments with a high sense of political responsibility and historical mission.
 
This is an inevitable requirement for promoting the sustained and healthy development of China's economy and society. At present, China's urban and rural grassroots social structure, interest pattern and the people's ideological concepts have undergone profound changes. Townships have increasingly become the meeting point of various interest relations and the gathering point of social contradictions. Under the new historical conditions, strengthening the service capacity building of township governments is an important part of safeguarding and improving people's livelihood, strengthening and innovating social governance, and an important guarantee for promoting sustained and healthy economic development and maintaining social harmony and stability.
 
This is an inherent need to strengthen the township government's own construction. The township government is the most basic political authority in China. It is an important implementer of the implementation of national laws, regulations and policies to the " last mile " , an important provider of basic public services, and an important organizer of grassroots governance. Since the reform and opening up, the service level of China's township governments has been effectively improved, but some township governments still have problems such as lagging service concept, weak service capability, inadequate service mechanism , backward service methods, and low service efficiency. We must adhere to the problem orientation and take effective measures to effectively enhance the service capacity of the township government and provide accurate and effective services to the people.

The "Opinions" clarify the guiding ideology, basic principles, overall goals and main tasks of strengthening the service capacity building of township governments. We must study hard.

Overall planning and implementation of classified guidance; by 2020, the township government's service capacity has been comprehensively improved, the service content is more abundant, the service method is more convenient, the service system is more perfect, and the basic functions are scientific, orderly, strong, efficient, and satisfactory to the people. Township government service management system and mechanism.
 
The second is to strengthen the service function of township governments. The "Opinions" proposes to speed up the pace of the transformation of township government functions, focus on strengthening public service functions; expand the service authority of township government services, and decentralize townships and towns to all kinds of matters that are directly oriented to the masses, large-scale and wide-ranging, and more convenient and effective by township service management. The government; promote the reform of township administrative law enforcement, promote the downward shift of administrative law enforcement, explore effective forms of comprehensive law enforcement in towns and villages, carry out comprehensive law enforcement work; coordinate the establishment of township party and government institutions and the management system of station management, and improve the management system of township and township stations.
 
The third is to optimize the allocation of basic public service resources in towns and villages. The "Opinions" pointed out that it is necessary to speed up the development process of urban and rural public service integration in accordance with the requirements of regional coverage, system integration and standardization; improve the basic public service input mechanism of townships, actively promote the equalization of basic public services, and support the construction of township infrastructure and public Service projects and social undertaking development; improve the township financial management system, reasonably divide the county and township financial affairs and expenditure responsibilities, and establish a system in which financial affairs and expenditure responsibilities are compatible.
 
The fourth is to innovate the supply of public services in towns and villages. The "Opinions" emphasizes the need to establish a multi-supply mechanism for public services, guide multi-party forces to participate in the provision of public services in townships, and increase the government's efforts to purchase services, from " spending money to support people " to " doing money to do things " ; improving the level of public service information To build an integrated online public service system for the public; to improve the expression and feedback mechanism of public service demand, and to strengthen the people's right to know, participate and supervise the decision-making and operation of public services.
