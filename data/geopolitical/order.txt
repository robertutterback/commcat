Editorial: How Should US-China Relations Proceed?
??On the first day of the new year, China and the United States celebrated the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations. The two heads of state exchanged congratulatory letters and emphasized the main tone of "coordination, cooperation and stability" of bilateral relations. This is not a diplomatic rhetoric, but has a strong realistic relevance. At present, the Sino-US trade war is still in full swing. The world must not be more alert to the zero-sum game mentality. It is more than one point of confidence that the interests of China and the United States are compatible and can work together to provide the public order of the international order.

??The 40 years of Sino-US exchanges are closely aligned with China's reform and opening up process. During this period, China has promoted the endogenous demand for change and external capital, technology and management assistance. As the most developed country in the world, the role and status of the United States is self-evident.

Core Tip: The report, published by National Intelligence Director Dan Coates, points to global trends such as weakening influence of international institutions, attacks on Western democracy, and isolationist tendencies within the government.
Reference News Network reported on January 23 The US version of the "National Intelligence Strategy" report released by the US intelligence agency on January 22 once again rendered the "China-Russia threat theory." The report claims that Russia and China are taking advantage of the "strategic environment" changes that have prevailed for nearly a century to gain influence and undermine US goals.
According to a report by Bloomberg on January 22, the report released by the US National Intelligence Director Dan Coates pointed out that global trends such as weakening influence of international institutions, attacks on Western democracy, and isolationist tendencies within the government have become the United States. A major challenge.
The report claims that Russia will continue to strengthen its influence and prestige, and may conflict with US goals and priorities in multiple regions. The report also said that although there are opportunities for cooperation between the United States and China on issues of common concern, China's military modernization and continued economic influence in the Pacific and other regions are still a "worrying issue."
The report shows that "the strategic environment is changing rapidly and the United States is facing an increasingly complex and uncertain world in which threats are increasingly diverse and interrelated."
The US intelligence agency publishes a National Intelligence Strategy report every four years. In the 2009 and 2014 reports, the so-called "China-Russia threat theory" was also mentioned. Although the latest National Intelligence Strategy has added new content such as the space field and the "weakening of the international order", in fact, the evaluation of China and Russia is still "changing the soup and not changing the medicine".
In response to the US rendering of the "China-Russia threat theory" in different types of relevant military reports, Russia and China are the competitors and major challenges of the US defense. The Chinese Foreign Ministry has repeatedly responded. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying once said that cooperation is the only correct choice between China and the United States.

 (Original title: US officials implied that China was expelled from the WTO? ??: Not long ago, the United States threatened to withdraw from the WTO)
The " Ministry of Foreign Affairs Spokesperson's Office" public news, at the regular press conference of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on November 22, a reporter asked: According to reports, on the 21st, the White House Economic Advisory Committee Chairman Hasett said that China as a WTO member " Misconduct, and said that it is necessary to consider whether to expel China from the WTO. Some analysts pointed out that the US speech has a suggestive meaning. What is China's comment?
Shuang Shuang : The WTO is a multilateral institution, not a US one. WTO members are equal, and the United States has no final say. Some Americans have hinted that China will be expelled from the WTO. Although it is destined to be an idiotic dream, it also exposes the face of the US power and bullying and the mentality of me.
According to incomplete statistics, for some time, the United States has withdrawn from international organizations such as UNESCO, the UN Human Rights Council, and the Universal Postal Union, and has withdrawn from the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP), the Paris Climate Change Agreement, the Global Immigration Agreement, A series of international instruments such as the Iranian nuclear agreement and the Optional Protocol to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations on the Compulsory Settlement of Disputes. The international community has its own clear vision of the United States' role of "destroying the contract" and "retreating the group" under the banner of "US priority". It is deeply concerned about the US's practice of "coinciding, disagreeing, and abandoning" multilateral institutions and multilateral treaties.
If I remember correctly, the United States also threatened to withdraw from the WTO not long ago. Today, I said that it is ridiculous to "expel" China from the WTO! There are differences among WTO members, which can be resolved through negotiation and negotiation. It is very dangerous to throw out the idea of ??"expelling" others. China is the largest trader of goods and the second largest economy in the world. Even China and the United States dare to clamor for "expulsion" from the WTO. What about other countries? Who will be next?
After China joined the WTO, it actively followed the letter. In July this year, the WTO conducted a trade policy review of China. All parties including the WTO Director General generally positively evaluated China's support and contribution to the multilateral trading system and highly appreciated China's growing role in the WTO.
The Chinese side is committed to building an open world economy and firmly supports the multilateral trading system with the WTO as its core. It is willing to work with all parties to promote the WTO to advance with the times and carry out reforms on the basis of adhering to its core values ??and basic principles. At the same time, China firmly defends multilateralism and maintains a rules-based international order. It is willing to work with the international community to promote a new type of international relations of mutual respect, fairness, justice, cooperation and win-win, and build a community of human destiny.

He continued: "I mentioned the BRICS countries as accidents because the leaders of Russia, China and India have said that India has now joined the SCO. The three countries of Russia, China and India have clearly become multilateral mechanisms such as the BRICS and the SCO. The locomotives. We are geographically adjacent to each other, politically speaking on the important issues of the international order, and we all hope that all disputes will be resolved in a peaceful manner, and we all hope that there will be a free, open and fair economic and trade system. The above facts make us an ally on these issues."

Indian Prime Minister Modi clearly stated that he opposed the United States to improve competitiveness and obtain unfair competition. For the purpose of advantage, sanctions are imposed on other countries more frequently in the multilateral economic and trade field.

On January 18, 2017, General Secretary Xi Jinping was invited to deliver a speech entitled "Building a Community of Human Destiny" at the UN Headquarters in Geneva. He pointed out that the current world is in an era of financial crisis, and various risks and challenges are emerging. The society must work together to promote a more rational new international order.

In fact, since the outbreak of the financial crisis in 2008, how to reform the irrational international order has become a topic of common concern to all countries. The discussion on the direction of the world and the international order is constantly deepening. The first big discussion after the outbreak of the financial crisis occurred before and after the crisis. The theme of the time was to explore the changes in the geopolitical pattern of the emerging powers reflected in the Beijing Olympics and the Russia-Georgia conflict. The second time occurred between 2011 and 2012, which was characterized by a discussion of the governance crisis highlighted by major events such as the "European debt crisis". The third time has been postponed since 2014. It is characterized by the 70th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations and the 100-year history of the First World War. The international community has made major international and domestic strategic adjustments such as the United States and Europe, the Ukrainian crisis, and the emergence of the "Islamic State". The deep contradiction of the refraction of the current international order is discussed.

Generally speaking, since the financial crisis, the international community's discussion on where the world is going is showing three major trends: First, the influence and the spread of the surface are expanding. Participants have expanded from the past, the United States, Europe and Russia to some small and medium-sized countries. Second, the discussion has continued to deepen, and the focus has increasingly pointed to the reform of the international order itself. From the past attention to changes in geopolitical patterns, related national governance dilemmas and other local issues, to the direct contradiction between the current order and structural contradictions, is the root cause of world turmoil. Third, countries began to believe that change has become the trend of the world, and the world is entering a period of great adjustment and great turmoil.

From the current point of view, the demands and cognitions of countries in this round of big discussions are clearly differentiated, and the mentality is more complicated. From the perspective of the United States, because of its long-term self-respect as the leader of the current international order, in the face of world change, its strategic anxiety and sense of crisis have intensified, and its mentality has become more conservative and tough. Former US Secretary of State Kissinger once admitted in a speech at the US Senate hearing that as the financial follow-up effect continues to ferment, the United States has never faced so many crises since the Cold War, and the old order is in crisis. The new stability is still difficult to establish, and the situation changes are "weet." And another important developed economy is clearly differentiated within the EU. In the face of changes in the world situation, some British people worry that the change may weaken their status as a big power, and turn negative on issues such as European integration, which has become an important reason for the British "Brexit." Although Germany is concerned about the possible impact of world adjustments, it also sees it as an opportunity to enhance its international influence. German Foreign Minister Steinmeier once wrote that the EU and the world are facing profound changes in the international order. Only unity can cope with it, and Germany can play a greater role in it. In France, due to internal challenges such as economic downturn and increased social unrest, it has become more introverted on international issues and its willingness to participate in global affairs has also decreased.

In contrast, Russia, which faced sanctions and isolation from Western countries, adopted a relatively strong attitude. Many Russian political figures, including Putin, have repeatedly criticized the United States as an important reason for disrupting the international order, and actively promoted the construction of regional and international order under the leadership of Russia, trying to use the Eurasian Economic Union, the BRICS and the SCO. To rely on, to hedge the isolation of Western countries. Japan has tried to take the opportunity to promote its own nationalization and step up the revision of the peace constitution and the US-Japan security cooperation. At the same time, the vast number of small and medium-sized developing countries want to change the situation of marginalization and worry about being the victim of the adjustment of the world and the international order. For example, the former Arab League ambassador to China, Sakitt, pointed out that although the current international order can no longer reflect the demands of the international community, especially in development, the accelerated adjustment of the international order and the game of big powers have also aggravated the difficulties faced by small countries.

As a fast-growing emerging power, China naturally occupies an important position in this discussion. How to look at where China will go in the future is the focus of attention. On the whole, the profound adjustment of the current international order and the discussion of various countries have made it increasingly difficult to adapt to the development and changes of the world. Systemic risks caused by disorder of order and lack of governance have become more prominent. Under this circumstance, the future concept of building the human destiny proposed by the Chinese government is bound to play an increasingly important role in leading the transformation of the world and the international order.

Asia-Pacific Economics under the change of the world

??2016 is a "cold" year for the international community. With the emergence of the "black swan" incidents such as Brexit and Trump counterattacks, the international political spectrum is eccentric and full of drama. On the one hand, conservatism returns strongly, on the other hand, people seek enthusiasm, social division and value differentiation continue to deepen. . Now that the end of the Cold War has been quarters of a century, the world is at a new crossroads, and some major contradictions have become prominent.

??The first is the confusion of governance and chaos. Will the world be safer or more chaotic? Although this issue is a matter of opinion, it is an indisputable fact that the world today is far less beautiful than expected at the turn of the millennium. The Middle East chaos, the European dilemma, and the Asia-Pacific puzzle are confusing, and they are hopeless in the short term. It may not be a stopgap to look at the future of American-style stand-by or "workout", but become the norm. When a US police image that advocates "return" and "rehabilitate" becomes increasingly clear, the world will face a more uncertain future. China adheres to the peace and cooperation essence of ancient Eastern wisdom and practices a new security concept. Its role and role must be further borne.

??The second is the change of opening and closing. The new round of globalization, which was born in the 1980s, is now facing a headwind, and trade protectionism in Europe and the United States is on the rise. The Brexit vote in the United Kingdom and the death of the TPP are a wake-up call to counter-globalization. It is said that the chaotic state does not live, the dangerous wall does not stand, the chaos of the world is closed, the world is open to the public, and the understanding and practice of the world's general trend are displayed between the opening and closing. Thanks to the foresight of Comrade Deng Xiaoping more than 30 years ago, China has firmly grasped the theme of the times of peace and development, braved the guise of globalization, and shared the dividend of globalization. At present, China is committed to promoting openness and cooperation with constructive programs and actions. The "One Belt, One Road" and free trade zone strategy is the opening up of China's upgraded version.

??The third is the struggle between the two. The world is facing chaos and disorder in the international order, which needs to be repaired and reconstructed. The decline in the overall strength of the United States has made it difficult for the leading international order to stand alone. The international order dominated by the United States and Europe is undergoing adjustment, and the new international order is still in the process of struggle, collision and gestation. The world is in a transitional period and a transitional period. As the world's largest developing country and developed country, a new rising power and a traditional big country, the wrestling between China and the United States largely coincides with the big game of order breaking and standing. Is it old or new? It depends on the benign strategic interaction between the world trend and China and the United States.

??Faced with such a large international background, the important strategic opportunity period for China's development still exists, and it is extremely important to maintain, use and extend this important strategic opportunity period. Especially in the strategic process of the periphery and the Asia-Pacific, the question of clearing up the chaos, grasping the trend of opening and closing, and observing the way of breaking should be the meaning of the title.

??For a long time, the Asia-Pacific region has been relatively stable and calm in the global strategy sector. In 2009, the Obama administration of the United States took the opportunity to withdraw from Europe and the Middle East and turned to the Asia-Pacific bet to stir up the situation in the Asia-Pacific region. However, in addition to giving the outside world the impression of a strategic impulsiveness, the United States has not taken too many chips from the strategic chess game against China. On the contrary, China has become more confident and determined in the crisis response. Up to now, the so-called "Asia-Pacific rebalancing" strategic economy is "broken leg" and politically unpopular. How far can the deterrence of military sticks go? It is not difficult to imagine that after the big change of the US government, the "Asia-Pacific rebalancing" strategy will either exist in name only, or change course and adjust. In any case, it will eventually become the unfinished political legacy of the Obama administration. In view of this, the establishment of a new type of relationship between China and the United States will also usher in new opportunities and spaces, which is a boon to the entire Asia-Pacific region and the world.

Build more of China's own global governance certification

??Canada recently formally applied to join Asian investment bank . As a non-founding member, Canada's participation has to go through a series of links. These links are in professional terms and are the certification process.

??Speaking of certification, people are familiar with it. It is a less obvious but extremely important part of the national governance and social governance system. From identity cards, social security cards, diplomas, professional certificates to patents, membership, products entering the market, etc., "certification" can be seen everywhere. It is worth noting that the phenomenon of certification is also increasing in international relations and global governance, and is increasingly becoming an integral part of the institutional power of big powers in global governance. To expand China's institutional voice in the global governance system, certification is a breakthrough that deserves attention.

??The core of certification is to establish rules and standards, and to form a scale expansion advantage of products, organizations or specifications through the promotion of a set of values, normative rules and practical standards. Certification has both international and international economic benefits. In terms of social benefits, it can expand its influence on value, norms, rules, and voice; in terms of economic benefits, many certification industries have become huge industries. For example, various English proficiency test certifications bring to the organizers. Considerable economic income.

??There are many certifications in the international political economy. In any creation or initial stage of any international order or international system, a set of value norms, rules systems, organizational structures, etc. will be identified. With the expansion of this international order, latecomers need to go through various certification procedures to join, and only become a member of the international order. In this regard, the value norm and rule system of this order actually form a certain educational effect on the newcomers. The vitality and vitality of order lies in the ability to attract and absorb more members and expand the scope of order. The major powers of the international order have mastered a strong institutional voice through the establishment, interpretation and reinterpretation of certification standards and procedures, and continue to shape newcomers through value norms and rules systems.

??Frankly speaking, a few Western powers still monopolize and control many of the certification indicators in international political, economic, and social life, such as various sovereign credit rating systems, many evaluation systems for value issues, "market economy status" certification, and important international Organize membership criteria and more. Certification also affects Western social science research. For example, the American social sciences like to set aside some so-called democratic standards and artificially divide other countries into democracy and non-democracy. As a result, some countries were delighted to find that they turned into a democratic country overnight. Some countries woke up and found themselves inexplicably become authoritarian countries. This kind of research conducted by academic scorpions naturally made a lot of trouble. joke. This is a feature of American-style propaganda. People must be discriminating against such certifications in academic terms.

??When China participates in global governance and strives for institutional power and discourse power in global governance, it needs to attach importance to the construction of a certification system based on me. In the past, we have paid more attention to various certification systems from the West. Sometimes it is inevitable that people will be blindly authenticated. People will take the nose and become part of other people's systems over time, but they neglect the construction of their own systems.

??From the development of China to the present stage, we must change from a passive thinking to an active thinking. Only in this way, innovations based on me will continue to burst out and truly lead the way rather than being led. For example, middle school students like to engage in mock United Nations activities. This activity does make sense, but we can engage in activities such as simulating AIIBs or new development banks that are more meaningful to China's development . As Chinese international influence expands, we need to focus on Chinese. Scientific certification of the international examinations; as more Chinese companies "go out", we also need our own investment destination country risk rating system, rather than simply following the existing rating companies, so that we can rationally guide enterprises to invest abroad. Flowing direction; how to do a good job of building Chinese as a community of international academic expression, and so on. These areas are the academic entrepreneurial direction that young people can seize and make a difference in China's participation in the global governance process, both economic and social.

Participating in global governance is the real "big country diplomacy"

"Democracy of the Great Powers" continues the super-high attention brought by CCTV's large-scale political monographs. The audience can fully appreciate the turbulence of the big countries in diplomacy. As the media reported, in the "Great Power Diplomacy", the audience saw that the Chinese concept is triggering an unprecedented resonance in the world. It is in this resonance that the diplomacy of a big country with Chinese characteristics writes a new chapter with unprecedented leadership, cohesiveness and appeal. At the new historical starting point, China has the determination and ability to realize the great dream of national rejuvenation, and has the determination and ability to work with the countries of the world to create a prosperous and beautiful future.

Being able to conduct foreign affairs is a basic defining element of a country, and how to fully exercise this external influence, so as to achieve a win-win effect including the country, to a large extent, to map out the country's comprehensive strength and development philosophy. The world today is a world of turbulence and a world of rapid changes. Peace and development are still the theme of the times. The international system and the international order are undergoing deep adjustment. In the context of the "unchanged changes of the millennium", the great powers Inter-divisional diplomacy or long-sleeved dance, or vertical and horizontal, or left and right, in the cycle of the output of national national strategic judgment and logic. In the far-off diplomacy of diplomacy, the earth gradually became a concept of a village. Although the world has become smaller, it was originally a divergence that can seek common ground while reserving differences, but it has evolved into a game theory of opposition. Among them, the argumentation on the governance of globalization has gradually become a confrontational point between the major powers.

Globalization was originally a macro concept put forward by the Western world. After the Second World War, under the rounds of different big country diplomacy, the pan-globalization strategy such as the Bretton Woods Agreement and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade was born. This also means that globalization governance has entered an emerging stage. Decades have passed, and the old capitalist powers have launched a wave of economic development again and again under the impetus of globalization, which has brought economic, political and cultural prosperity. End of the last century, the World Trade Organization the right to ICP to the summit, and EU countries have begun to implement a single currency, the euro, will globalization to a new height.

It can be said that globalization is the product of great-nation diplomacy. But in recent years, the voice of anti-globalization has come one after another, and there is even the possibility of going directly from the field to the center of the stage. These trends are precisely the result of the process of diplomacy in big countries. First, the British referendum was taken off the European Union. It was a diplomatic discourse with the European "maternal body" in a way that outsiders felt very unharmonious. Later, Italy, the fourth largest economy in Europe, also intended to follow suit. Moreover, Trump was elected president of the United States. When he was on the phone with the President of Mexico, he talked about the construction of the wall at the US-Mexico border. As for the cancellation of the TPP and the ban on Muslims entering the United States, it is also the US anti-globalization policy. Big killer.

Many Western powers have played counter-globalization cards and are reluctant to carry out global governance responsibly. This is not the so-called "reverse behavior", but based on the consideration of maximizing national interests. However, the unfairness of this "three decades of Hedong, thirty years of Hexi" is that in the context of enjoying the benefits of globalization and facing the new normal of global development, some European and American powers intend to use "starting another stove". The way to redefine the world's development order. This kind of concept, in the case of a few large countries holding financial, resources, transportation and other real chips, is more likely to produce the "Matthew effect", so that the vast number of developing countries once again missed the development of the shuttle.

In "Great Power Diplomacy", there is such a commentary - "More than 7 billion people live together on our planet, we should look to help each other, help each other and develop together." For globalization, it is destined to be the general direction of humanity in the future. In the current situation of extreme uncertainty, a responsible big country needs to stand up, respond to many changes with a positive attitude, and form a synergy with the style of big country diplomacy. At this time, China issued a "stable self-confidence of a socialist country with Chinese characteristics, proposed a grand blueprint for building a community of human destiny, deepened the all-round diplomatic layout with the goal of developing a global partnership, and established the opening up of the "One Belt, One Road". The sound of the new pattern.

"World peace builders, global development contributors, and international order defenders" - China has always been at the forefront of the times in the struggle for building a community of destiny in the many puzzles and interests brought about by anti-globalization. China does not fight economic wars and does not engage in ideological output. Instead, it uses the specific form of development and the diplomatic channels of docking each other's interests to truly form an arch of the globalization economy and global governance. In this process, China used the "Belt and Road" to lay out its own ideas and created classic cases including "high-speed rail diplomacy". And this is another special "big country diplomacy."

China's "One Belt, One Road" initiative is a model project combining economic globalization and localization. Its main purpose is to build a new type of state relationship in the regional common market of "equal, balanced, shared, and win-win" in the "destiny community" emphasized by Chinese diplomacy. This is more convincing than the diplomatic rhetoric of some big countries. In contrast, the world has given more respect to responsible countries that are willing to shoulder global governance.

"China will actively participate in the construction of a global governance system, strive to contribute to China's wisdom in improving global governance, and work with people around the world to promote a more just and rational direction in the international order and global governance system." President Xi Jinping's remarks made a sound statement. It shows China's attitude towards a big country in global governance. The diplomacy of a big country under the attitude of a big country will inevitably set off a whirlwind of charm.

??There is such a worldwide day. Since its establishment, the United Nations has held a commemorative meeting every year. President Xi Jinping has sent a congratulatory message to the General Assembly for five consecutive years. This shows the international justice of this anniversary, which shows China's international sentiments and The big country is responsible. This day is the "International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People" - the 32nd General Assembly of the United Nations passed a resolution on December 2, 1977, and selected November 29 of each year, asking governments to commemorate this day in various ways to mobilize international The society supports the struggle of the Palestinian people to realize their inalienable national rights.

??The question of Palestine is the core of the Middle East issue and the root cause of peace in the Middle East. November 29, 1947, Liange Guo General Assembly adopted resolution 181 (II), provides for a "Jewish state" and "Arab state" in Palestine. However, since the adoption of the resolution for seventy years, there has not yet been a Palestinian state that is independent of the sovereignty of the State of Israel. For a long time, the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have made substantial progress. During this period, there have been many armed conflicts, resulting in the death of thousands of people. It can be said that the Palestinian issue is a "wound" that has not been healed for a long time, which has triggered constant tension and conflict throughout the Middle East. This is also the reason why the United Nations chose to position the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People on November 29. This day is of great significance to the Palestinian people. It also provides an opportunity for the international community to face up to the fact that the Palestinian issue has not yet been resolved, to promote the issue of a comprehensive and just settlement at an early date, and to promote long-term stability and prosperity for the countries of the Middle East.

??"In the face of people suffering from misery and war, we must have compassion and sympathy, but we must also have responsibilities and actions." President Xi Jinping expressed China's international sentiments and powers in the 2016 New Year message. Not only does China say so, it does the same. In recent years, China has been vigorously promoting the settlement of the Palestinian issue. In addition to sending a congratulatory message on the International Day of Solidarity, President Xi made relevant proposals on the Palestinian issue in 2013. In 2016, he delivered an important speech at the headquarters of the League of Arab States to restate China's position. In July this year, he proposed a new situation to promote the settlement of the Palestinian issue. Four-point proposition" - firmly push forward the political solution based on the "two-state plan"; adhere to the common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security concept; further coordinate the efforts of the international community, strengthen and promote synergy; comprehensive policy to develop Promote peace. These efforts, especially the "four-point proposition", reflect the lofty ideal of President Xi's advocacy of building a community of human destiny and reflect China's political stance of firmly supporting the just cause of the Palestinian people. Under the guidance of the "four-point proposition", China will also persuade and promote talks in its own way, inject positive energy into the resumption of talks and the peace process, and contribute "Chinese wisdom" to the settlement of the Palestinian issue.

??The world is so big, there are so many problems, what about China? "Promoting the building of a community of human destiny and jointly creating a bright future for mankind" is a major strategy that has been written into the report of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China and has become one of the basic strategies for adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics. It is the most important in today's world. The developmental difficulties have responded to the general concerns of the international community, solved the biggest confusion in people's minds, and pointed out the direction for world development and the future of mankind. As a permanent member of the UN Security Council and an advocate and promoter of the new international order, China has always been centered on peace, stability and development in the Middle East and is committed to promoting peace, development and prosperity for mankind. Communicate and promote talks between Palestine and Israel, "One Belt and One Road" to build a world of communication, and new forms of international relations... A responsible China is actively participating in the reform and construction of the global governance system, and is using China's wisdom, strength and responsibility. The dream of the people of the world for peaceful development. The international community also looks forward to hearing China's voice and seeing China's plan. China cannot be absent, and China is committed to always being a builder of world peace, a contributor to global development, and a defender of the international order.

??Human beings live in the same global village, and countries are increasingly interdependent. You have me, I have you, and you share your destiny. China is also increasingly approaching the center of the world stage. The "friend circle" is getting bigger and bigger, and the international sentiments and the powers of the big countries are more firm and strong.

The community of human destiny is not a tributary system

In recent years, the concept of the community of human destiny proposed by China has spread to the international community and has been included in the UN documents, and its influence has become increasingly widespread. In particular, with the deepening of the construction of the "Belt and Road" and the smooth operation of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank , the community of human destiny is moving from concept to action. Under this circumstance, the view that China will once again rule the "world" will also appear, and there are still quite a market in the western world. Some Western scholars wrote: "If the relationship between the West and the world is manifested as aggression and conquest, then the relationship between China and the world is shown as an unimaginable obsession with the highest level of status." "China's power will also force the rest of the world." The country silently acts in accordance with the Chinese way." As a result, some people in the world are worried that China will once again rebuild the "order of the world" through the tributary system and develop the ancient tributary system into a modern version. Obviously, this is a misinterpretation of the concept of the community of human destiny and a distortion of China's active commitment to international responsibility and the promotion of international development cooperation.

??For a long time, the West has promoted freedom, democracy and a market economy to ensure peace, human rights and economic prosperity, and actively export Western models to the world. China believes that a one-size-fits-all model will not be effective for all countries. Therefore, it always respects the right of people of all countries to choose their own development path. It never tries to export its own values ??like some Western countries, nor does it export Chinese models to other countries. In fact, China has been bullied by Western powers in modern times, and has done what it does not want to do. It has always opposed Western countries' interference in other countries' internal affairs through economic and military means. China's promotion of the "Belt and Road" and the assistance provided to developing countries will not require the partners or the aided countries to make such changes, as in Western countries, but believe that only their own people can determine their social and political systems. It can be said that compared with other major powers, in international affairs, China has taken all measures to fully consider the common interests of all countries and strive to find a balance between pursuing its own interests and realizing the common interests of all countries. Building a shared global governance philosophy.

??China has always respected international law and advocated the international rule of law. It adheres to the principle of sovereign equality and non-interference in internal affairs and promises that China will never seek hegemony. President Xi Jinping reiterated at the commemorative meeting marking the 60th anniversary of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence that "the country is equal and small, strong and weak, rich and poor, and all of them are equal members of the international community and have the right to participate in international affairs on an equal footing. The affairs of each country should be The people themselves come to control." He also pointed out that we do not "enter" foreign models and do not "export" the Chinese model. In the process of promoting the building of a community of human destiny and building a new type of international relations, while emphasizing the common interests of the international community, China does not deny the national sovereignty and the interests of the individual state, and emphasizes the promotion of the principle of independent sovereign equality and non-interference in internal affairs. The cooperation of the international community in various fields promotes the integration of common interests and national interests.

??It can be seen that the concept of the community of human destiny has a similar vision to the ideals of "the world of the world and the family of the world" in ancient China. They all express the views of the coexistence, coexistence and common development of all countries. However, they are fundamentally different from the "order of the world" or "the tributary system." Today, China does not export value and civilization to other countries, nor does it require higher status than other countries, nor does it promote hegemonism. Instead, it pursues "harmony and difference," mutual benefit and win-win results, and pursues common development of all countries. Common prosperity, common security, and a shared environment. No matter whether it is the "Belt and Road" construction or the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank , it is not necessary to establish a political community, and it will not touch the sovereign red line. Instead, on the basis of respecting the sovereignty of all countries, we will strive to expand the intersection of interests of all countries in the world and promote The healthy development of economic globalization and the hope that countries can share the benefits brought about by China's development show that China wants to develop well and hope that others will develop well. In fact, in modern times, China has gained national independence and national sovereignty through long-term arduous struggle. Therefore, it is very clear that other countries attach importance to sovereignty. It is clear that building a community of human destiny must respect and safeguard the sovereignty and development interests of all countries. This is clearly different from some Western countries trying to promote an international order that transcends sovereignty over human rights.

The debate of the UN General Assembly reflects the intense contest between unilateralism and multilateralism

The 73rd Joint is opened at the United Nations Headquarters in New York on September 18. The general debate will take place from September 25th to October 1st. The theme is "Dedicated to making the United Nations relevant to all people: global leadership and responsibility sharing, promotion Building a peaceful, fair and sustainable society."

Espinosa, the new President of the UN General Assembly, called for efforts on seven priorities: gender equality and women's empowerment; implementation of new global immigration and refugee contracts; creation of decent work opportunities for all; and emphasis on environmental protection; Deepen political and social commitment to persons with disabilities; revitalize the United Nations ; promote peace and security and give play to the role of young people in conflict prevention. There are quite a few things to watch in the general debate of the UN General Assembly:

First, the violent contest between unilateral and multilateral, globalization and anti-globalization

On the one hand, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres hopes to use this opportunity of the general debate of the UN General Assembly to enhance the authority and status of the United Nations and reunite the confidence of all parties in multilateralism. In his opening speech at the UN General Assembly, Guterres pointed out that "our world is suffering from the "trust deficit". Trust is on the verge of collapse, including trust in state institutions, trust between nations, and Rule-based trust in the global order."

On the other hand, the tendency of the United States to counter globalization and anti-multilateralism has become more apparent. Following the withdrawal of the Paris Agreement, this year the United States has successively withdrawn from UNESCO and the Human Rights Council, not participating in the UN- led Global Refugee and Immigration Contract, and announced a substantial reduction in funding for the United Nations Palestine Refugee Relief Agency and the Counter-Terrorism Mechanism, resulting in some institutions. Inefficiency or even cease to operate has severely challenged the United Nations multilateralism framework.

US President Trump said in the general debate that "the United States rejects the ideology of globalism and does not accept global governance. The United States advocates the patriotism of creed and always chooses independence and cooperation." US Ambassador to the United Nations Heili Zeng Public criticism of the United Nations is inefficient, saying that it may continue to reduce funding for the United Nations in the future .

Second, the trend of hot issues such as the Iranian nuclear issue has received much attention.

The United States unilaterally announced its withdrawal from the Iranian nuclear agreement in May, and in August it resumed sanctions on Iran's financial, metal, mineral, and automobile sectors. This session of the UN General Assembly is the first global multilateral conference after the United States withdraws from the Iranian Nuclear Agreement.

Iranian President Rohani stated in the general debate that some countries are trampled on the international system and "wrapped" international security for domestic political needs, which is very dangerous. He also stressed that the United States "illegal unilateral" withdrawal from the Iranian nuclear issue "Joint Comprehensive Action Plan" is "reversing the car", those seeking hegemony are the enemy of world peace.

During the current session of the UN General Assembly, Trump will personally preside over the special meeting of the UN Security Council on the UN Security Council to further pressure Iran. China, Russia and other six countries will hold ministerial meetings. How the parties can express their position and find a way out for the Iranian nuclear issue has aroused great concern from the international community.

Third, the prospects for global governance and global issues

The first is the issue of climate change. After the United States withdrew from the Paris Agreement, the parties concerned became increasingly anxious about the implementation of the Paris Agreement. Secretary-General Guterres hopes to arouse the urgency of climate issues during the UN General Assembly and to pave the way for the Polish climate conference in December.

The second is the issue of sustainable development. On the 24th, Guterres convened a high-level meeting on the financing of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Participants generally agreed that the financing gap for achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals is still large and needs to accelerate the pace and scale of financing. Guterres also launched a forward-looking financing strategy to achieve the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, requiring global economic and financial policies to interface with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and strengthening the sustainable development agenda at the regional and national levels. Financing.

Fourth, China has become the backbone of multilateralism.

Most countries represented by China support globalization, support multilateralism, and support the authority of the United Nations . Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said at the opening ceremony of the Mandela Peace Summit: "At present, the rise of unilateralism and protectionism is seriously impacting the contemporary international system centered on the United Nations . The international community must unite under the banner of multilateralism and maintain The central role of the United Nations in international affairs provides more stable expectations for the turbulent world." This year, China has successively hosted multilateral summits such as the Shanghai Summit and the China-Africa Forum. The concept of "community of human destiny" has become more popular.

The current international situation is complicated and changeable. In June, the 23rd to 23rd, 2018, the Central Foreign Affairs Working Conference was held in Beijing. General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee, President of the State Council and Chairman of the Central Military Commission Xi Jinping delivered an important speech, stressing efforts to create a diplomatic diplomacy with Chinese characteristics. New situation. The speech is rich in content, profound in thought, and open to the future. It presents the following "four new".

First, the guiding ideology of innovation, first proposed "a new era of diplomacy Xi Jinping thought socialism with Chinese characteristics", both the depth of refining the theory and practice of diplomacy since the eighteen, but also to a new era of large overseas Chinese characteristics Bank long-term stability Zhiyuan guidelines, Including "ten adherences":

Adhere to the principle of "maintaining the authority of the Party Central Committee as the leader", strengthen the party's centralized and unified leadership over foreign work, adhere to the "mission to realize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation", promote "political diplomacy with Chinese characteristics", and adhere to "maintaining world peace and promoting common development".

General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed the need to comprehensively implement the "new era of socialist diplomatic thinking with Chinese characteristics" and constantly create good external conditions for the realization of the "Chinese dream" of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and the promotion of the "community of human destiny."

Secondly, the strategic thinking method is innovative, explaining the methodology of comprehensively and accurately grasping the international trend and foreign strategic operations, emphasizing the external favorable conditions facing China, including the "three views":

First, the "correct view of history" depends not only on what the current international situation is, but also on the "historical telescope" to review the past, summarize historical laws, look to the future, and grasp the historical trend.

The second is the "correct overall situation", not only to see the phenomenon and details, but also to grasp the essence and the overall situation, to seize the "main aspects of major contradictions and contradictions", to avoid getting lost in the ever-changing international chaos The direction, the end of the book.

The third is the "correct role view". It is necessary not only to calmly analyze various international phenomena, but also to "put yourself in", to look at the problems in our relations with the world, to clarify the status and role of China in the evolution of the world structure, science. Formulate China's foreign policy. It is emphasized that China is currently in the "best period of development in modern times", and the world is in a "big change in a hundred years."

We must grasp the general trend of "the overall stability of the international environment" and pay attention to the situation of "intricate international security challenges"; we must grasp the general trend of "communication and mutual understanding of various civilizations" and attach importance to "the mutual stimulation of different ideas and cultures" The reality (such as "pattern dispute", etc.).

At the critical moment of the reform of the international system, China firmly stands on the right side of historical progress, and sees the mainstay of the mainstay.

??"This is a great story of our time, not a Chinese thing, a story of ours, a story of all mankind." The American "Time" magazine once commented on the significance of China's reform and opening up to human development and progress.

??Self-reliant, self-Dada. Standing at the important time of the 40th anniversary of reform and opening up, looking back at the struggle stories written by China and the world, we can truly feel that China's reform and opening up is a powerful force for promoting world peace and development, and it is the Chinese nation's progress towards human civilization. Significant contribution.

??China has always been an important promoter of global openness. Over the past 40 years, China's foreign trade has achieved both scale and quality. China's total foreign trade volume increased from 0.8% in 1978 to 11.5% in 2016, and the contribution rate to global trade growth in 2017 exceeded 20%. China is the world's largest exporter, providing a large number of inexpensive goods for the world market. For every 10,000 US dollars of Chinese manufacturing exports, the world's jobs have increased by an average of 11.52; China is the world's second largest importer. It is estimated that in the next 15 years, China's imports of goods and services will exceed 30 trillion US dollars and 10 trillion US dollars respectively; Chinese enterprises actively "go global" and promote economic development and technological progress of various countries.

??China has always been a stable source of power for world economic growth. I still remember that during the Asian financial crisis, China was under tremendous pressure and insisted that the renminbi would not depreciate, making an important contribution to the financial stability of Asia and the world. During the international financial crisis, China's strong economic growth and positive crisis response injected more confidence in global economic and financial stability than gold and currency. Today, China has become the world's second largest economy, contributing more than 30% to world economic growth for many years. In the face of the sluggish recovery of the world economy and the challenges of economic globalization, China's insistence on promoting an open world economy will undoubtedly contribute more to the world's economic growth.

??China has always been a vibrant market for countries to expand their business opportunities. At the first China International Import Expo, 172 countries, regions and international organizations attended the conference, more than 3,600 companies participated in the exhibition, and more than 400,000 domestic and foreign buyers attended the conference to negotiate purchases, which reflected the full vitality of China's big market. Tesla officially signed a contract with Shanghai for the first super factory outside the US. ExxonMobil will build a large-scale wholly-owned petrochemical project in Guangdong... Multinational companies will vote with their feet to actively share the dividends of China's economic development. The World Bank has raised China's global business environment rankings by 32 at one time, praising China's reforms in related fields "surprisingly fast and effective."

??China has always been an active contributor to global governance reform. China firmly adheres to the international order. At present, China has joined more than 400 multilateral treaties, participated in all UN specialized agencies and about 90% of intergovernmental international organizations, and fully integrated into the contemporary international order. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, President Xi Jinping has repeatedly expounded China's new ideas and new ideas on global governance in major diplomatic occasions, proposed new measures and new measures for China to solve important issues of global governance, and promoted the global economic governance system toward a more just and reasonable. Direction development. The 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China further clarified that the diplomacy of a big country with Chinese characteristics should promote the construction of a new type of international relations and promote the building of a community of human destiny. The wisdom of China, which contributes to the improvement of global governance, carries the hope that China will make new and greater contributions to mankind and demonstrate China's role as a responsible big country.

??The trip to the avenue is also the world. Lagarde, the president of the International Monetary Fund, praised that "China is building a road to the future", giving a vivid footnote to the magnificent picture of China's ambitions in the global perspective. China's reform and opening up conforms to the historical requirements of the Chinese people for development, innovation, and a better life, and is in line with the trend of the times in which all peoples of the world want to develop, cooperate, and live in peace. China, which is increasingly approaching the center of the world stage, has become a recognized builder of world peace, a contributor to global development, and a defender of the international order. At the moment, at the critical moment of the transformation of the international system, China firmly stands on the right side of the historical advancement, and more clearly sees the mainstay.

China's plan to reshape the global governance system

In today's world, the tide of economic globalization is rolling forward, but protectionism and unilateralism have cast a shadow over world economic growth; new technological revolutions and industrial changes are poised for growth, but the kinetic energy conversion of world economic growth has not yet been fully released; Deep evolution, but the imbalance of development has not fundamentally changed; the global governance system has been profoundly reshaped, and the international structure has accelerated, but the lag of governance is still a prominent challenge. How can we grasp the right direction for the development of the world economy? How can we find an effective governance solution for the international community?

In the face of the ups and downs of development and change, President Xi Jinping has clearly stated at the APEC Business Leaders Summit that he has insisted on five important propositions of openness, development, tolerance, innovation and rule orientation. These five important propositions are closely related to each other, and each has its own focus. It is highly targeted, and the key to governance is to cure the protectionism and unilateralism with "openness"; to protect basic human rights with "development" and to enhance people's well-being; to eliminate it with "tolerance" Pride and prejudice; use "innovation" to stimulate the vitality of development, better serve the people of all countries; use "rules" to heal double standards, arbitrariness and self-interested dysfunction. These five propositions follow the laws of the economy and the historical trend. The goal is to achieve the common development of mankind and the comprehensive policy of China's contribution to the world today.

As an ancient civilization with more than 1.3 billion people, the world's second largest economy, and a responsible developing country, China is responsive to historical development and the trend of the times, and actively participates in global governance reforms, not only contributing to China's programs and wisdom. And it boosted the confidence of the world. Xi Jinping used three "more", that is, "a more responsible spirit, a more open and inclusive mind, and a higher quality of growth" to declare China's position and determination. China will continue to adopt reforms and opening up, relying on the wisdom and diligent hands of the Chinese people to make greater contributions to the common prosperity of all countries while realizing its own development.

As the defender and builder of the current international order, China adheres to working together with other countries to develop together under the framework of global governance. As the pace of integration into economic globalization continues to accelerate, China's role as a major power in world economic development and global governance has become increasingly prominent. Starting from the height of building a community of human destiny, China should take the initiative and take responsibility, actively promote the reform and innovation of the global governance system, and inject more and more positive energy into China for world development.

China news agency, Beijing, June 4th: From the AsiaInfo Summit to the Shangri-La Dialogue, China elaborated on the Asian security concept.
??China News Agency reporter Liu Xu
??Although the Shangri-La Dialogue held in Singapore recently closed, some of the focus issues of concern during the period are still continuing to ferment. The keynote speech of Wang Guanzhong, deputy chief of staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, at the meeting also triggered the international community's attention to the concept of China's Asian security concept.
??On the 21st of last month, the first phase of the Fourth Summit of the Asia Cooperation and Confidence Measures Conference was held in Shanghai. In the keynote speech, Chinese President Xi Jinping elaborated on the common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable Asian security concept, emphasizing Establish differences and disputes through negotiation and negotiation, and establish a new regional security cooperation framework.
??Reuters commented on Xi Jinping's speech that China intends to dilute the concerns of China from the outside world and emphasizes that China will not sacrifice its security in the maritime rights dispute to seek its own absolute security. Bloomberg News also pointed out that China's role in soft power has become increasingly prominent in the process of dealing with territorial disputes with neighboring countries.
??But during the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore in early June, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and US Defense Secretary Hagel sang and blamed China for unilateral actions in the South China Sea to declare sovereignty and turmoil. In his speech, Hagel publicly accused China of "destroying the stability of the South China Sea region" and warned that "When the international order is threatened, Washington will not be indifferent." India's "Economic Times" news believes that the US and Japan's stance is "aggressive", which brings tension to Asia-Pacific security.
??As Wang Guanzhong said in his speech, "I don't come to indecent assault." The Chinese representative responded decisively to the unprovoked public provocations and accusations of the United States and Japan. The BBC News said that Fu Ying, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the National People's Congress of China, accused Abe of "trying to modify Japan's security policy by threatening regional security." The "Peking Diploma Asia-Pacific Affairs Magazine" website quoted Wang Guanzhong as saying, Hagel's speech is full of hegemonic taste and is a challenge to China.
??In a keynote speech entitled "Building an Asian Security Concept to Create a Bright Future for the Asia-Pacific", Wang Guanzhong focused on China's Asian security concept, emphasizing China's opposition to interference in other countries' internal affairs, opposing any country's pursuit of monopoly regional security affairs, and opposing strengthening the defense. The position of the three-party military alliance.
??Although China has a fierce confrontation with the United States and Japan at the meeting, it is undeniable that this has also become a major feature of the dialogue. The BBC reporter pointed out that the dialogue was a good opportunity for senior representatives of the countries in the Asia-Pacific region to face-to-face exchanges in an attempt to resolve regional tensions. The "Private Asia-Pacific Current Affairs Magazine" bluntly stated that the speeches of the representatives of the three countries of China, the United States and Japan "are the most worthy of expectation" and said that the tripartite confrontation "has no disappointment" and attracted the attention of most media.
??The Shangri-La Dialogue has become the largest security dialogue mechanism in the Asia-Pacific region and the highest level of attendance at all levels. China's choice and representatives of various countries have "talking straight", even if "the smell of gunpowder" is not necessarily a bad thing, frank exchange dialogue. Perhaps more conducive to the resolution of regional contradictions.
??Chinese Defense Ministry spokesman Yang Yujun also said at the last press conference of the Shangri-La Dialogue that "the discussion of major Asia-Pacific affairs in the Asia-Pacific region, as the organizer does not want the Chinese to be absent, the Chinese themselves do not want to. China Active participation is beneficial to the Asia-Pacific region."
??The agenda of the Shangri-La Dialogue has ended, but Asia-Pacific security issues remain a long-term focus for the countries of the region and the international community. Judging from China's recent statement, Xi Jinping's Asian security concept advocated at the AsiaInfo Summit was widely recognized by the delegates of the participating countries. The Chinese representatives also gave speeches, answered questions from participants, participated in TV debates, and participated in the Shangri-La Dialogue. Forum discussions and other forms to convey China's new concept of security to the outside world.
??However, compared with this, the speeches of the representatives of the United States and Japan more reveal the regional security concept dominated by the military alliance, trying to pull more countries under their wings through the "pull gang" to be outdated. The Cold War mentality has torn the security cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region.
??From a certain perspective, China and the United States and Japan advocate two different "Asian security views." The two concepts of old and new may continue to collide in the future. The final choice must be made by the Asia-Pacific countries. A historical answer to regional peace and security cooperation. (Finish)

?China news agency, Beijing, February 26 (Reporter Ma Haiyan) Experts here said that using legislation to remember history and safeguard peace can unite people's hearts and seek common development, and the international community can pay more attention to that history.
??On the afternoon of the 25th, the 7th meeting of the Standing Committee of the 12th National People's Congress reviewed the draft decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on determining the Victory Day of the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japan and the draft decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on the establishment of the National Day of the National Day of the Nanjing Massacre.
??These two drafts, which were different from previous drafts on a certain construction field, were released to the public and caused strong public concern. The draft will be September 3 as the Victory Day of the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression. It will be the National Day of the National Day of the Nanjing Massacre on December 13 and quickly become the headline of various websites. These two days are once again reflected in the eyes of hundreds of millions of netizens. inexpensive.
??Gao Hong, deputy director of the Institute of Japanese Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said in an interview with a reporter from the China News Agency that, in general, in a civilized society ruled by law, a country needs various bills to regulate the code of conduct, which is different in national governance and social development. Different problems appeared in the stage, and the corresponding laws came into being. These two drafts are also aimed at letting the people of the new era and the future remember the history and forget the national humiliation on the occasion of the 65th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, with a global and long-term significance.
??Gao Hong said that World War II is the history of the Chinese nation's blood and tears. It is also a history of the Chinese nation's struggle against it. It is also an important starting point for promoting national awakening and national self-improvement, and it has far-reaching significance. History must be clear. Legislation is not only the need to discern historical right and wrong, to unite the positive energy of the nation, to prevent the recurrence of historical tragedies, but also to maintain regional stability and international peace.
??Gao Hong believes that in the early post-war period, there was still a lot of sinful feelings in Japan, and the reflection on the war also dominated the mainstream. The right-wing forces would not get the majority recognition if they wanted to set off the storm. Gao Hong specifically mentioned four important documents concluded at different times since the normalization of diplomatic relations between China and Japan: the Joint Statement on the Restoration of the Normalization of Diplomatic Relations between China and Japan in 1972, the Sino-Japanese Treaty of Peace and Friendship in 1978, and 1998. Under the guidance of these four documents, the Sino-Japanese Joint Declaration and the 2008 Joint Statement on the Promotion of Strategic and Reciprocal Relations have developed relatively stable relations. Although the Japanese right-wing forces have also been provoked, there has not been a big storm. .
??Gao Hong said that the problem has really been serious in recent years. Japanese society has generally become more conservative, and extreme nationalist sentiment has begun to rise. In particular, after Abe's second come to power, he has not broken the historical reversal, from the issue of "comfort women" to "history textbooks", from "promoting constitutional revision" to "Revising the zero-nuclear target"... Inverting black and white again and again, beautifying the history of aggression and causing great indignation in the countries affected by the war. In Japan, where various political forces are now taking turns, the history is no longer clear. Today, in response to the words and deeds of Japan as a country of aggression, some people must seriously review the history. China and other war-affected countries will of course wage a tit-for-tat struggle.
??Gao Hong cited the example of Germany. As a country that has made historical mistakes, Germany has the Anti-Nazi Law. It is not allowed to promote Nazi ideas in any form. It is strictly forbidden to use Nazi signs. It is not allowed to preserve the monuments of Hitler and Nazi officials. And the tomb, this guarantees from the social atmosphere that the Nazis will not be revived in various names. In contrast, Japan's attitude has chilled the people of the victimized countries in Asia.
??Gao Hong said that China has passed the legislation to declare the correct claims of China to the international community and it is necessary for the international community to understand China. For Japan's history of aggression, the feelings of war-affected countries and third countries are not the same, and the degree of understanding and discrimination of history is different, but the goal of maintaining the international order established after World War II and safeguarding hard-won peace is the same. . If you let more people recognize history, they can better face the future. While China commemorates the heroes and heroes, it is not allowed to warn the country to tamper with history. It is a just claim from any angle. (Finish)

The road to the future that fits the trend of the times (bells)

At the critical moment of the reform of the international system, China firmly stands on the right side of historical progress, and sees the mainstay of the mainstay.
"This is a great story of our time, not a Chinese thing, a story of ours, a story of all mankind." The American "Time" magazine once commented on the significance of China's reform and opening up to human development and progress.
Self-reliant, self-Dada. Standing at the important time of the 40th anniversary of reform and opening up, looking back at the struggle stories written by China and the world, we can truly feel that China's reform and opening up is a powerful force for promoting world peace and development, and it is the Chinese nation's progress towards human civilization. Significant contribution.
China has always been an important promoter of global openness. Over the past 40 years, China's foreign trade has achieved both scale and quality. China's total foreign trade volume increased from 0.8% in 1978 to 11.5% in 2016, and the contribution rate to global trade growth in 2017 exceeded 20%. China is the world's largest exporter, providing a large number of inexpensive goods for the world market. For every 10,000 US dollars of Chinese manufacturing exports, the world's jobs have increased by an average of 11.52; China is the world's second largest importer. It is estimated that in the next 15 years, China's imports of goods and services will exceed 30 trillion US dollars and 10 trillion US dollars respectively; Chinese enterprises actively "go global" and promote economic development and technological progress of various countries.
China has always been a stable source of power for world economic growth. I still remember that during the Asian financial crisis, China was under tremendous pressure and insisted that the renminbi would not depreciate, making an important contribution to the financial stability of Asia and the world. During the international financial crisis, China's strong economic growth and positive crisis response injected more confidence in global economic and financial stability than gold and currency. Today, China has become the world's second largest economy, contributing more than 30% to world economic growth for many years. In the face of the sluggish recovery of the world economy and the challenges of economic globalization, China's insistence on promoting an open world economy will undoubtedly contribute more to the world's economic growth.
China has always been a vibrant market for countries to expand their business opportunities. At the first China International Import Expo, 172 countries, regions and international organizations attended the conference, more than 3,600 companies participated in the exhibition, and more than 400,000 domestic and foreign buyers attended the conference to negotiate purchases, which reflected the full vitality of China's big market. Tesla officially signed a contract with Shanghai for the first super factory outside the US. ExxonMobil will build a large-scale wholly-owned petrochemical project in Guangdong... Multinational companies will vote with their feet to actively share the dividends of China's economic development. The World Bank has raised China's global business environment rankings by 32 at one time, praising China's reforms in related fields "surprisingly fast and effective."
China has always been an active contributor to global governance reform. China firmly adheres to the international order. At present, China has joined more than 400 multilateral treaties, participated in all UN specialized agencies and about 90% of intergovernmental international organizations, and fully integrated into the contemporary international order. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, President Xi Jinping has repeatedly expounded China's new ideas and new ideas on global governance in major diplomatic occasions, proposed new measures and new measures for China to solve important issues of global governance, and promoted the global economic governance system toward a more just and reasonable. Direction development. The 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China further clarified that the diplomacy of a big country with Chinese characteristics should promote the construction of a new type of international relations and promote the building of a community of human destiny. The wisdom of China, which contributes to the improvement of global governance, carries the hope that China will make new and greater contributions to mankind and demonstrate China's role as a responsible big country.
The trip to the avenue is also the world. Lagarde, the president of the International Monetary Fund, praised that "China is building a road to the future", giving a vivid footnote to the magnificent picture of China's ambitions in the global perspective. China's reform and opening up conforms to the historical requirements of the Chinese people for development, innovation, and a better life, and is in line with the trend of the times in which all peoples of the world want to develop, cooperate, and live in peace. China, which is increasingly approaching the center of the world stage, has become a recognized builder of world peace, a contributor to global development, and a defender of the international order. At the moment, at the critical moment of the transformation of the international system, China firmly stands on the right side of the historical advancement, and more clearly sees the mainstay.

Foreign Ministry spokesman Yan Shuang said on the 22nd that US officials have hinted that expelling China from the World Trade Organization (WTO) is destined to be an idiotic dream, exposing the face of the US power and bullying and the mentality of me.
At the regular press conference on the same day, a reporter asked: According to reports, on the 21st, the White House Economic Advisory Committee Chairman Hassett said that China as a WTO member "misbehaves" and said that it should consider whether to expel China from the WTO. . Some analysts pointed out that the US speech has a suggestive meaning. What is China's comment?

"The WTO is a multilateral institution, not a United States. The WTO members are equal and not the United States. The US has hinted that China will be expelled from the WTO. Although it is destined to be a dream, it also exposes the US. Powerful bullying's face and my only mindset." Yu Shuang said.
He said that according to incomplete statistics, the United States has withdrawn from the international organizations such as UNESCO, UN Human Rights Council and Universal Postal Union for some time, and has withdrawn from the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP), the Paris Climate Change Agreement, and the world. A series of international instruments such as the Immigration Agreement, the Iranian Nuclear Agreement, and the Optional Protocol to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations on the Compulsory Settlement of Disputes. The international community has its own clear vision of the US side's "American priority" banner of "destroying the contract" and "retreating the group". It is deeply concerned about the US's practice of "coinciding, disagreeing, and abandoning" multilateral institutions and multilateral treaties.
He said that after China joined the WTO, it actively followed the letter. In July this year, the WTO conducted a trade policy review of China. All parties including the WTO Director General generally positively evaluated China's support and contribution to the multilateral trading system and highly appreciated China's growing role in the WTO.
Yu Shuang said that China is committed to building an open world economy and firmly supports the WTO-based multilateral trading system. It is willing to work with all parties to promote the WTO to advance with the times and carry out reforms on the basis of adhering to its core values ??and basic principles. At the same time, China firmly defends multilateralism and maintains a rules-based international order. It is willing to work with the international community to promote a new type of international relations of mutual respect, fairness, justice, cooperation and win-win, and build a community of human destiny.

Beijing will not engage in zero-sum in the AIIB

Japanese diplomatic scholars website December 5 article, original title: China's new bank's environmental significance October, 21 Asian countries signed an agreement to build an Asian infrastructure investment bank in Beijing, China is the main supporter. But can this new bank practice the best management and environmental practices?
Although the Western world may be concerned about the loss of influence in the growing Asian market, or the potential challenges of the US-led international order, the AIIB has also raised another concern: Chinese funds may pose a potential threat to current international standards for foreign aid.
Elizabeth Economi, a senior fellow at the American Association for Foreign Relations, and her colleague Michael Levy believe that the best way to understand the impact of Chinese overseas investment on the host country is to observe its domestic operations, while the Chinese government and Capital companies do not pay much attention to environmental protection. But they also found that the social and environmental awareness of Chinese companies has improved in recent years. This is first and foremost due to top-down efforts: To reduce unsustainable development, the Chinese leadership is introducing various incentives for domestic and foreign investment, encouraging companies, especially state-owned enterprises, to participate in international initiatives that focus more on corporate social responsibility.
The second change comes from the outside. As more Chinese companies go abroad, they are increasing their exposure to best practices from foreign counterparts. In addition, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce is encouraging them to participate more actively in the UN Global Compact and other international assessment systems to improve the international image.
Finally, the third change stems from the bottom up, that is, the public is increasingly aware of the negative environmental and social impacts of Chinese investment, and the active participation of NGOs in promoting the change of Chinese companies.
Even so, any of the above motivations are not enough to completely change the basic logic of China's pursuit of growth at all costs. If the country of investment lacks strict environmental protection regulations and effective enforcement mechanisms, China Enterprises will still not give up the "tested" and outdated business model.
Cai Jinyong, the first Chinese CEO of the World Bank International Finance Corporation, said that China's overseas investment projects are generally good at construction rather than long-term management. Environmental impacts are an important part of managing sustainable projects, both in terms of financial and social impact.
Ikonomi recently wrote that the international community, especially the United States, should consider the establishment of an AIIB as an opportunity to introduce sound environmental standards into China's Asia-led infrastructure investment projects. But is China ready to accept the participation of the United States and its allies in this multilateral initiative? What is certain is that the Chinese leadership knows that long-term international influence depends not only on hard power, but also on soft power, especially the social and environmental impacts of China's widespread presence around the world.
Just as Joseph Nye, the pioneer of the concept of soft power, once said: "The development of soft power does not need to be a zero-sum game. All countries can benefit from mutual attraction." From China and the United States and other developed and developing countries in Asia. Leaders need political wisdom and professional cooperation to ensure the sustainable development of the world's most populous and fastest growing regions. ?

Great power diplomacy distinguishes between friends and foes

In 2013, China began the transformation of "great power diplomacy". Previously, the "big powers" in China's diplomacy refer to the diplomatic countries of the United States, Japan, Russia, Germany, France, Britain, India, and Brazil. Today, "great powers" refer to China itself. The change of diplomatic status has brought a new challenge to our diplomatic philosophy, namely, whether diplomacy needs to distinguish between friends and foes.
From no alliance to no distinction between friends and foes
Before the "Non-Aligned" principle of "China does not depend on any big country or group of countries" in the 1982 report of the 12th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, our diplomatic philosophy is to clearly distinguish between friends and foes. In the 1950s, according to the similarities and differences with our social system, the country was divided into "imperial state", "capitalist country", "nationalist country" and "socialist state". In the 1960s and 1970s, adjustments were made into the first world (superpower), the second world (developed countries outside the superpower), and the third world (developing countries) according to the degree of similarity with China's international status. Although the standards for these two categories of countries are different, they all reflect the political and diplomatic ideas of distinguishing between friends and foes at that time.
Under the guidance of the principle of non-alignment, the Twelve Major Reports put forward the "Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, which apply to our relations with all countries including the socialist countries." Since then, China's diplomacy has begun to dilute the concept of friends and foes, and the task of diplomatic service to economic construction has shifted the ranking of developing countries. The countries of the diplomatic target in the 12th report are Japan, the United States, the Soviet Union, and the Third World. The 1987 report of the 13th National Congress of the Communist Party of China abolished the order of the countries of diplomatic relations and proposed "developing friendly cooperative relations with all countries in the world." The practice of not distinguishing between friends and foes reflects the diplomatic concept of economic cooperation.
After the political turmoil of 1989, the US-led Western countries imposed comprehensive sanctions against China, but the vast number of developing countries and Western countries have different positions. Faced with this reality, the national classification was resumed in the diplomatic work of the 14th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in 1992, but this time it was divided into two categories, namely the third world (developing countries) and "all countries" (meaning " Non-developing countries"). This kind of national classification is to establish a balance between clear diplomatic focus and no distinction between friends and foes. The 1997 report of the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China found a national classification method that does not distinguish between friends and foes and clear diplomatic priorities, namely neighboring countries, the third world (developing countries) and developed countries. The division methods of these three types of countries have continued to this day, but the 2002 report of the 16th National Congress of the Communist Party of China adjusted the ranking of the three types of countries to developed countries, neighboring countries and developing countries. This sort of country classification was summarized in 2006. "A big country is the first priority, a periphery is the key, and a developing country is the foundation." Its advantage is that it makes all kinds of countries seem equally important, and enhances the flexibility of diplomatic principles, that is, which type of country is the main target of diplomacy. Some people think that this sort of country classification is in line with the era of globalization. It is said that diplomacy is invincible in the era of globalization, and the diplomacy that distinguishes between friends and foes is "Cold War thinking."
However, this sort of country classification also has drawbacks. When the flexibility of the principle is strong, the guiding role of the principle is weakened. For example, in Southeast Asia, Cambodia and the Philippines are both developing countries around me, but the former can serve as my diplomatic basis while the latter is my diplomatic trouble. Russia and Japan are similar countries. I need to strengthen comprehensive strategic cooperation with Russia, and only political isolation for Japan. The three words "primary", "key" and "basic" are juxtaposed, and it is impossible to clarify what kind of country is the focus of diplomatic work. The United States is only a big country but not a neighboring country, and Japan is both. Japan is both "primary" and "critical" and theoretically more important than the United States, but this is clearly not in line with the actual situation.
The interests of big countries can be achieved by distinguishing the diplomacy of friends and foes
In the next decade, China's overall national strength will be greater than that of all countries except the United States, and the gap will increase. China will have to maintain its international interests by providing more international responsibilities and maintaining public order by providing public goods. Taking on international responsibilities, proposing China's programs, contributing Chinese wisdom and providing more public goods face difficulties in not distinguishing between the enemy and the enemy. Only by clarifying who is responsible, who is good for it, who can help, and who can enjoy the public goods, can we decide what to do. In the shaping of the international order, any major power is responsible for protecting the friends and not the enemy, proposing solutions that are beneficial to the partners rather than the competitors, and providing public goods to countries that follow the rules rather than undermine the rules.
Specifically, it is difficult for us to implement the diplomatic principles of "pro, sincerity, favor, and tolerance" without distinguishing between friends and foes. For example, in the current situation, politically, we can get close to Russia and Cambodia, but we cannot get close to the Abe government in Japan and the Aquino government in the Philippines, otherwise they will adopt a more anti-China policy. In diplomacy, we can only talk about integrity in countries with formal diplomatic relations. For those countries that do not recognize China's sovereignty and support Taiwan's separatism, there is no question of whether or not to talk about integrity. Economically, China can take the initiative to benefit the backward developing countries and not the developed United States. In the international politics, the weaker initiative to benefit the strong is not in line with morality, it is the flattery of the weak to the strong.
In order to shape the international environment conducive to national rejuvenation, China's foreign policy may consider dividing the country categories according to interest relations and providing a clear political direction for formulating specific foreign policies. If China divides the countries of the world into four categories: "friendship", "cooperation", "ordinary" and "conflict", for countries with weak overall strength than China, regardless of the size of the country, China will adopt a policy of benevolence and mutual assistance to friendly countries. A policy of appropriate care for cooperative countries, an equal and mutually beneficial policy for ordinary countries, and a policy of tit-for-tat for conflicting countries.
The United States is the only country that is stronger than ours. Therefore, we can consider the United States as a single category and a "new-powered country." The nature of the new type of big power relationship is the relationship between the rising country and the leading country in peaceful competition, and the strength comparison is that the US is strong and weak, so my policy toward the United States should be equal and mutually beneficial. Strictly speaking, under the conditions of different strengths, peer-to-peer mutual benefit is already beneficial to the strong. Therefore, adopting a policy of mutual benefit to the United States has already reflected the inclusiveness of China's foreign policy.
Since the Opium War, China has accumulated a wealth of diplomatic experience with weak systems, but less modern diplomatic experience with weaker and weaker. For example, non-alignment is a weak and strong diplomatic strategy under the bipolar pattern. Historically, small countries are not common, but the phenomenon of non-alignment between the Empire and the superpowers is rare. Whether diplomacy adopts the concept of distinguishing between friends and foes or not being friends and foes is a new subject facing the diplomacy of China's great powers. ?

Focus on China
China is becoming a "different" big country

The US "Wall Street Journal" May 27 article, the original title: China has become a "other" big country Beijing is becoming a more normal economy, but an abnormal big country. Economically, its double-digit growth rate has gradually slowed to a more common rate of growth in middle-income countries. As the status of the private sector increases, the Chinese economy is no longer immune to market forces and debt ratios, and is more vulnerable to global economic risks - a part of the cost of becoming a more normal economy.
At the same time, Beijing has ended the more passive foreign policy of the past. This shows a more confident China's arrival. However, China's ability to exert influence on the global stage is still limited, and its experience in dealing with sensitive issues is far less than its economic achievements.
Compared with the rise of Europe, the United States and Japan, China will be an abnormal big country. Unlike other countries, where the rise is basically continuous and the process is long, China is unique in that it accounted for 30% of global output before returning to the status of a big country, but fell to less than 5% by 1950. Today, after 30 years of rapid growth, the proportion is still only half of the previous one. Other countries have not encountered the problem of being old and old like China. Beijing has always tried to balance domestic struggle with a changing international order.
A few years ago, Washington, for its own interests, hoped that China would become a "responsible stakeholder." Today, almost no one believes that China is a passive ruler in a system that is largely established by the West and ignores China's rise. On the contrary, it is more likely to be a challenger, moving in the grey area and changing the balance of power when it comes to its huge core interests in Asia.
China's previous passiveness was to calm the outside world, so that other countries would not limit their development potential. Nowadays, the Asian turn of the United States is regarded by the Chinese as a containment strategy. Under such circumstances, the concept of "peaceful development" will no longer work. China is willing to take stronger action, which is no different from other big countries. But it is really different from other big countries. Beijing does not explicitly agree with which group or series of issues, and the choice of partners, the composition and intention of the alliance are also very different.
A more confident China will continue to cause tension and uncertainty. But Beijing's goal is to push to change the existing international system rather than overthrow it. The Chinese leaders' proposal for "Asian Asians" and the Silk Road Initiative is more about finding practical solutions than developing big strategies. (Author Huang Yuchuan, translated by Qiao Heng)

Big country diplomacy does not have to be inferior

Professor Yan Xuetong's article "Global Weekly" is more important than the United States. The critics believe that the essay may have the illusion of ignoring big countries, especially the United States. After all, the United States is still the world's best. Big countries, Japan and Europe are still the main partners of my economic development; and the endorsers believe that this topic is very meaningful in itself. China's diplomacy needs to establish key points, invest strategic resources in the construction of the "Belt and Road" and operate a good surrounding. Instead of competing with the United States, it consumes my diplomatic resources. At the same time, China is traditionally an inland civilization, blindly heading for the ocean, and will only collide head-on with the US maritime hegemony. It will go to Eurasia and operate the "World Island" (the British geopolitical scientist McKinsey), which is to play traditional civilization. Advantages.
In fact, the views of criticism and approval are not contradictory. The surrounding area that Mr. Yan said is the overall periphery, and it also includes the influence of the United States. Because the United States (and even Japan) can be described as ubiquitous around China, it is impossible to bypass the US and Japan. The emphasis on the periphery also reflects the importance attached to the United States, but bid farewell to Sino-US relations as the "top priority" of China's diplomacy. In other words, the importance of attaching importance to the United States through the periphery and the importance of the United States through the United States are the dialectical thinking of the unity of opposites. The importance of Sino-US relations has shifted from the human rights represented by the past 3T-Taiwan, Trade, and Tibet issues to a broad range of areas in the Asia-Pacific region and China. China-US competition and cooperation have increasingly focused on me in space, and more and more focused on the international order in time. China has become a capital exporting country, a major exporting country, a big country of innovation and innovation, and a rule and standard power. This is the United States. new challenge. To this end, Obama's State of the Union address has vowed "never let China rule."
Diplomacy-centered diplomacy, big countries are naturally the key, because the funds, technology, and export markets we need are in big countries. Today, China's relations with the world have opened up to me from the opening of the West to the world. The surrounding countries and developing countries have become the export places of my capital and technology, so as to strive for the right to standardize and trade and invest in rules. More importantly, China's diplomacy should be a two-wheel drive for security and development. The surrounding area is the place where I live and settle down, the foundation of development and prosperity, and the importance is reflected in both security and development, and even extends to the level of influence and regional cooperation initiative. This is the idea that Yan Wen proposed to promote the community of China and its surrounding destiny with the construction of the "Belt and Road". In the past, we emphasized "transportation" - common interests, mutual benefit and win-win situation. Now we must also focus on "life" - common identity and common security. From the history of the rise of the great powers, it is not the first to operate the surrounding areas. The surrounding area is restless, and there is no way to go; the surrounding area is not rich and cannot be independent.
Having said that, when you are still focusing on the big country or the periphery, you have not really regarded yourself as a big country. I am the leader of my diplomacy. The diplomacy of a big country with Chinese characteristics should bid farewell to the big-country-peripheral dualistic thinking of "the big country is the key, the periphery is the primary", starting from its own strategic goals, rather than simply paying attention to interests and feelings, starting to plan and operate foreign relations. The "Belt and Road" itself is both land and sea, walking on two legs. Whether it is operating the mainland or going to the ocean, it requires innovative diplomatic thinking and exploring new modes of cooperation between land and sea.
In a nutshell, the diplomacy of a big country with Chinese characteristics does not have to be inferior to one another. If this is the case, it will take care of it, and should take care of it to achieve the coordinated development of national interests and other countries' interests, short-term interests and long-term interests, local interests and overall interests. Whether you are surrounded by a big country or a big country, you are flexible and comfortable, and you are good at it. ?

The US commander called "power is justice" in the South China Sea

The newspaper's special correspondent in Japan, Lan Ya Ge, reporter Tan Wei ? Feng Guochuan
US Pacific Fleet Commander Swift on the 16th in Australia did not name the accusation that China should respond to the South China Sea issue with the "power and justice" attitude, and the US continued to speculate in the South China Sea. Han Xudong, a professor at the National Defense University, said in an interview with the Global Times on the 17th that the US statement showed that they did not recognize the nature of their interveners and also made historical cognitive errors.
According to a report by the BBC on the 17th, Swift said in a meeting at the Maritime Safety Conference in Canberra about the situation in the South China Sea. "Some countries" have been militarized and aggressively built in the disputed territory. "Reclaim land, build ports and runways. , also deployed surface-to-air missiles." He said that in the region, "power is justice" has a tendency to recover. In the past 70 years since World War II, "national action based on the principle of 'strength is justice' has re-emerged, and freedom of the sea is at risk." Swift said that although the economic development of the Asia-Pacific region after World War II was based on a legal-based international order, "some countries" did not, and "abandoned the international order." He believes that if the United States does not promote free navigation in the South China Sea, it will lose its ability to sail freely in international waters, which is more likely to impact the global economy and international law. Although Swift did not name it, many foreign media reported the title of "Targeting China".
The Associated Press said on the 17th that the US Pacific Command Commander Harris also said in the Federal Senate last month that China is trying to control East Asia. This Swift speech continues the consistent attitude of the US in the Asia-Pacific military. The Associated Press said that as part of the "Asia-Pacific rebalancing" strategy, the United States is continuously strengthening its military presence in the South China Sea.
Han Xudong said that the US military personnel have been rushing to the front line in rendering the South China Sea tension. They use their own voice power to make hype in the international community. The so-called "power is justice" has been popular for some time, but it was during the First World War, when the imperialist countries were vying for spheres of influence, and China is now completely different from its own sovereignty and maritime rights and interests. Swift described China's defense of territorial sovereignty as "the power is the truth". Not only did it not recognize the essence of the US as an intervener, but it also had historical cognitive errors.
As the US frequently rubs against China on the South China Sea issue, international public opinion is very concerned about whether there will be a military conflict between China and the United States. The Lebanese "Daily Star" said that the United States wants to avoid a direct military conflict and shows that it is not a "threat" to China. In the South China Sea issue, the Obama administration is slipping dangerously with China. Negative stage. The controversy over the South China Sea issue is so fierce because the US government wants to respond to China's regaining "great power." The US "Dhaka Tribune" said that the United States has a "serious flaw" in its foreign policy toward Asia. The declaration issued after the summit meeting with ASEAN leaders last month "shielded" the details of the South China Sea issue. On the other hand, the US Seventh Fleet has not played any substantive role. It has only a few military bases in Japan, South Korea and Singapore, and does not have the support system established by the Chinese Navy in the South China Sea. The US "Washington Post" said that the White House already has a complete plan for future conflicts, including the "tit-for-tat" strategy, that is, the United States helps the Philippines and Vietnam build artificial islands and reefs. At the same time, the United States or the United States, Singapore, India and European countries jointly challenge China's sovereignty. Just like a US military general said, "It is not necessary to make China lose face, but we must let China understand that going down this road will only help you."
Han Xudong said that the United States has been continually shouting and invading, indicating that they want to promote the militarization of the South China Sea issue in order to profit from it. Once there is a conflict, the US will push the responsibility to China. In addition, the United States continues to speculate on the South China Sea issue and has realistic economic interests. They want to sell weapons and equipment. Han Xudong emphasized that it is obviously unrealistic for the United States to accelerate the construction of its leading Asia-Pacific order and use its norms to "regulate" China. ?

Today is the 70th birthday of the United Nations . October 24, 1945, " United Nations Xianzhang" came into force, the United Nations was established.
Looking back on the past, the United Nations has made tremendous efforts and made great contributions to the cause of peace, development and human rights. From 51 founding members to the current 193 Member States, the United Nations has become the most universal, representative and authoritative intergovernmental international organization. Of course, the United Nations has done something that should not be done, has not done something that should be done, and has done something that is not good enough.
Looking at the present, the United Nations and the international community are facing a host of new challenges and new problems. There are a lot of conflicts in the world every day, and there are 836 million people living in extreme poverty around the world. Global issues such as terrorism and climate change threaten the survival and development of human society. The United Nations itself is also facing the test of reform, the people of the United efficiency of the General Assembly, a representative of the Council, Secretary-General of the method of selecting its governance capability of the Council more than a dissatisfaction and criticism. The Trusteeship Council "has no name", the sex scandal of peacekeepers, the 68th session of the UN General Assembly chairman is being investigated for corruption allegations, and so on, all of which have created greater public pressure. In short, the authority of the United Nations needs to be strengthened through reform.
Looking to the future, the international community is full of expectations for the United Nations . The United Nations has just held a series of summits on development, peacekeeping and women. Leaders' goals and commitments on peace operations, the new development agenda, South-South cooperation, and the role of women in peace and security require action by the United Nations and its Member States. The ability of the United Nations institutions, resources and capabilities to adapt to international security, world development, global governance and the future international order is still full of uncertainty.
It can be said that the United Nations is not a panacea, but without the United Nations it is impossible. So what kind of UN do we need ?
First, we need a more democratic United Nations . UN Taikuai 193 Member States embodied in universal and most representative is the United Nationsfoundation authoritative. In addition to advocating the values ??and concepts shared by humankind and formulating a global agenda and program, the role of the UN General Assembly in peace and security and the selection of the Secretary-General needs to be strengthened. The representation of the Council and the democratic nature of its working methods need to be improved through reforms. On major international political and security issues, we must respect the sovereignty and voice of small and medium-sized countries; in global development and governance, we must consider and take care of the interests and concerns of small and medium-sized countries; in the promotion of human rights, we must listen more to civil society and non- The voice of government organizations and vulnerable groups. Despite the large number of multilateral organizations and mechanisms, only the United Nations provides us with the most effective way to achieve democracy in the international community.
Second, we need a more effective United Nations . The United Nations is a system whose effectiveness and efficiency, including resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council, the work of the Economic and Social Council and the Secretariat, the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice , etc., depend both on capacity-building and coordination within the United Nations , as well as on Member States. Provide support and cooperation.
Finally, we need a stronger United Nations . " Lian Heguo Xianzhang" is the international community's constitutional documents, is the foundation of the international order. It is a strong premise for the United Nations to safeguard the authority of the charter, carry forward the spirit of the charter, and play the role of the charter . It is a strong source of the United Nations to reform and enhance the representation of the Security Council and improve the operational capabilities and efficiency of United Nations agencies . Strengthening the rule of law in the international arena, strengthening the international order based on the rule of law, and improving the ability to resolve international disputes through political and legal channels are the strong guarantees of the United Nations . ?

China and the world meet in Davos this week

Chinese President Xi Jinping paid a state visit to Switzerland from 15th to 18th and attended the 2017 annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos . President Xi will also visit the UN Headquarters in Geneva, the World Health Organization and the International Olympic Committee .
It was the first time that China's top leader attended the Davos Forum , so it was a sensation. In the past few days, the world media has been reporting this matter early and commented a lot.
The importance of strengthening communication between China and the world is becoming more and more prominent. China's development into the world's second largest economy, how will it go in the future, China's current economic downturn is what is going on, the new round of economic reform can be successful, the outside world is very concerned. In addition, globalization has come from many challenges. What attitude does China hold and whether it can provide new kinetic energy for economic globalization?
China's political system and social logic are different from those of the West, which makes it difficult to understand each other's ways of thinking. Being able to get close to China's top leaders has a strong appeal to the world economy, this time the Davos Forum offers such an opportunity.
However, the outside world must obtain comprehensive information from President Xi Jinping's attendance at the forum and his speech, and accurately understand them. It is necessary to establish some basic understanding of China. These understandings should be realistic and unbiased.
First of all, China is a diligent and low-key big country. The rise of China is the hard work of the Chinese people. It is not a matter of intrigue and tricks. The Chinese economy still has a lot of stamina. The fundamental reason is that there is still a big gap between Chinese society and developed countries. The Chinese people feel that the existing days are not good enough, and the whole society is willing to continue to struggle and continuously obtain new improvements. But the Chinese people are clear that we can't just be good in China, others are not good, we want everyone to be good together, and that situation must be done by reality, not by flickering, and by opportunism.
Second, China does not want to challenge the United States, nor does it want to subvert the existing international order. We are the beneficiaries of this order, why should we not go with it? China is willing to contribute to the promotion of trade liberalization and cheer for globalization. But to be honest, if the United States really betrayed globalization under the leadership of the Trump administration, and fully acted to reverse the car, let China provoke the gird of globalization, and then become the commander of globalization, leading some countries and the United States to "stand up to court" Then China is afraid that it has neither such great strength nor high ambition. China is better suited to be one of the most dynamic forces in the global torrent.
Third, in recent years, China and the West have had frictions. Some people think that China is "arrogant." In fact, China's core interests circle is still limited to the periphery of geography and those areas that are related to political stability of the country. China's "front" has not been extended with the expansion of our trade circle. In addition, most of the friction is difficult in the West, and China is forced to respond. Until now, China has said that it is "so powerful" in the West. It is always a small country of the Western powers to interfere in China's internal affairs. It has almost never heard of China interfering in the internal affairs of a small Western country.
Fourth, around the South China Sea dispute, China has been the most accused by the West in the past two years, but China's infrastructure construction has taken place on its own controlled island reefs, and there is no "grab" of island reefs controlled by neighboring countries. And in the end, China has a good coordination with the Philippines and Vietnam. China has not shot a shot in 30 years. Is this really a country that "forces its own power to change the rules of the world?"
Fifth, China is a country that is very willing to get along with other countries. Even if there is a serious contradiction with a small country, we are very concerned. Beijing does not pursue the power that can be used to control and coerce other countries. The world can look for the world map. Where can it be regarded as China's "sphere of influence"?
In this turbulent era, China is a partner of all countries, a constructive force for safeguarding the common prosperity of mankind, and a serious actor who promotes the revitalization of the world economy. We may not be 100% good, but this is at least our sincere wish. For the Davos Forum , the Chinese leadership has attached great importance and respect to it. This is a microcosm of Beijing's attitude towards the world. We must be strict with China, and we will be more kind to our goodwill, and the world will be more beautiful. ?

China's strength is still difficult to support global leadership

 [US] Stephen S. Roach
There is no doubt that the withdrawal of the United States from the TPP means that the global order formed after World War II began to show a shocking crack. The dystocia of the Doha round of negotiations has made the global trade liberalization swing, and the TPP abortion is the strongest tool for free trade. Multilateral trade agreements have long been recognized as a glue for globalization. If this component is removed, the risk of splitting will only intensify, and the perception of global economic leadership will be injected with new uncertainties.
TPP is not a lack of well-thought-out framework agreement, but its conditions in terms of workers' rights, environmental standards, intellectual property protection, food safety and cybersecurity are too harsh and do not resonate with the populist anxieties of the middle class. Therefore, the world urgently needs to think about how to develop in the TPP era.
This is also where China needs to weigh. As the main economic entity in Asia, the main initiator of the RCEP covering 16 countries, the United States abandoning the TPP is an unmistakable opportunity for China. As RCEP minimizes tariffs, it is seen as an important starting point for enhancing deep regional economic integration. The next round of RCEP negotiations will begin in Indonesia in early December, and it will work with the AIIB and the BRICS Development Bank to highlight China's determination to lead the Asia-Pacific economy.
In addition, China's "Belt and Road" vision, as well as the International Monetary Fund's approval of the renminbi to join the SDR currency basket, will enhance this trend. Coupled with the change in Duterte's shift of diplomatic focus from the United States to China, many people believe that China can quickly occupy the vacuum of the post-TPP world.
However, the global leadership's baton has never taken the place in a logical way. Think about Trump's "US priority" attitude, it is difficult for the United States to give up its role. The United States may bring something different to the world, but it will continue to take seriously the responsibilities and opportunities it carries as the world's leading economy and the strongest military power. In the past eight years, the United States has played a heavy role in the process of playing this role. After the depression of 2008-2009, the status of the United States as the global hegemon has been shaken. The economic recovery is not expected to trigger a strong rebound in domestic populists, giving Trump an opportunity. The same result was confirmed in Brexit. If internal troubles cannot be resolved, the desire for global power will diminish.
China should learn from the lessons of the United States and Britain. As China moves from a manufacturing-oriented manufacturing power to a consumer power, risks and opportunities coexist. Debt-intensive growth, real estate bubbles and zombie companies are particularly prominent. Failure to address these issues will lead to a long-term economic slump and dampen the global leadership goal of the "China Dream."
From the perspective of the United States, TPP is not only a paper trade agreement, but also an initiative to ensure that China will not rewrite global trade rules by excluding China. Even so, the demise of the TPP does not mean that China's process of taking over American leadership in Asia or even on the global stage will be logical.
The rise and fall of great powers will go through a long and arduous history. The extension of geopolitics will be doomed to failure if it lacks the support of strong economic power. The United States needs to cope with the dilemma, but it is itself a prosperous and strong developed country. In terms of per capita GDP, China is relatively poor and is facing the "middle income trap" problem. This is also the last threshold for most developing countries to transition to developed countries.
Therefore, the Chinese-led RCEP cannot significantly break the global balance of power in the post-TPP era. China's foreign strategic goals, including the "Belt and Road" and initiatives in the South China Sea, clearly represent that its regional role is entering a new phase, but it is still too early to say that China has taken a big step toward global leadership. Only by continuously paying attention to policies and reforms and accelerating the imbalance of domestic economic accumulation can China take over the global baton. After all, global leadership begins with the support of internal strength. ?

Network security can no longer be maintained by "patching"

The ransomware virus that broke out in the first half of the year is still full of lingering fears. A few days ago, another news shocked the majority of netizens: "WiFi has a major security hole that affects almost all wireless devices." Especially for Chinese netizens, WiFi is almost like air and water, and it is difficult to leave.
The major security vulnerabilities discovered by Belgian researchers were not from the superb hackers, but from the WiFi encryption protocol standard itself, so it spreads globally. As a result, in addition to security companies, major software and hardware companies have begun to look for loopholes and patches, and almost no mainstream manufacturers are spared. Fortunately, no major losses have been reported globally.
It seems that this may be another storm. The Internet has been in existence for nearly 50 years, and the security issue has always been "congenital deficiency, not acquired." The Internet, which advocates openness, freedom, and sharing, did not prioritize security at first, so it is not favored by professionals. However, the Internet has become one of the most successful technological changes in human history. Today, the number of Internet users has exceeded 3.7 billion, and the penetration rate has exceeded 50%. The Internet has become a truly global social infrastructure.
In Internet security, the unknown is much larger than known. The biggest "miracle" is probably that, in the past 50 years, although the security risks have never stopped, so far, the Internet has not experienced a truly major catastrophic crisis. This is of course a good thing, but it also has a huge negative impact, so that there is no truly global and effective network governance mechanism. As a result, on the one hand, people's dependence on the network is increasing day by day; on the other hand, fragmentation of network governance is becoming more and more serious.
Especially in recent years, more and more global and national cyber security issues have erupted, and the problem of insufficient security at the beginning of Internet design has become more and more obvious. However, the current global basic rules are missing, the defense system is missing, and the response mechanism is missing. It seems that only after the outbreak of the global Internet catastrophic event, after all the pains and pains, the global community can really pay attention to it and act. Just as the terrible human tragedies of World War I and World War II have enabled the nations of the world to truly join hands and establish the international order of today. Nowadays, the disordered situation of cyberspace is becoming more and more serious, and the increasingly serious cybersecurity threat is undoubtedly testing countries, especially governments.
The natural luck of human beings and the natural inertia of governments have made the global Internet a powerful and effective mechanism for dealing with major security issues. Organizations of the traditional international order, such as the United Nations , either fail to keep up with the needs of Internet development or do not really play a key role in network governance. The globally efficient response mechanisms, collaboration mechanisms, defense mechanisms, disciplinary mechanisms, and recovery mechanisms are as high as the sword of Damocles.
China has the largest group of Internet users in the world, and Chinese netizens are more dependent on the Internet than European and American countries. Therefore, China is expected to become the world's only one-million-level netizen's large-scale simultaneous online super-test site. It is conceivable that with this near-water platform, China will face the challenges of new cybersecurity and crisis earlier than in Europe and the United States. Therefore, China should take precautions against cybersecurity. Whether it is the construction of laws and regulations, or the response to technology and applications, we must have a sense of urgency and action ahead of the world. China needs to change the negative strategy that has been followed in the past, and take the initiative to actively test the cyber security. This should be a new breakthrough for China to make a unique contribution to the global Internet. ? (The author is the Dean of the International Internet Research Institute of Shantou University)

China's international influence is facing five major challenges

US "Diplomatic Scholar" website June 26 article, original title: China's fight for international influence faces five major challenges For any rising power, it is normal and necessary to ensure and enhance its position and influence in the international community. And "discourse power" is a viable way to achieve multiple economic and political goals. Given the diversity and complexity of world politics, China faces at least five challenges in its fight for its international voice, all of which are major issues that hinder China's goals.
First of all, there is an inherent "original sin" view of the rising China. This preconceived prejudice sees China's rise as a heresy, and naturally brings uncertainty and instability to the Western-led system. From this point of view, China must seek and in fact seek more commonalities in international activities, such as providing more international public goods. For China, the final fact may prove that "original sin" is not established.
Second, the emphasis on the "rule-based" system. The United States has always accused China of its bad behavior, such as the importance of "rule-based international order" in the disputes between the East China Sea and the South China Sea. Of course, this order was established under the absolute leadership of the United States after World War II. In fact, the current rules-based order is exclusive and dominated by American values ??and ideas. This exclusivity is precisely what China should eliminate when it seeks the right to speak internationally, but it will be a hard battle.
Third, there is a phenomenon that the author calls "seeing trees without seeing the forest." Although China has made great achievements in many social and economic aspects, the reports of Western media are still aimed at individual people or things, and then they are interested in magnifying the comments on the whole of China. This situation is particularly evident in the human rights issue in which the West and China have contradictory views. In terms of human rights discourse, the West sees and values ??individuals or things, sometimes because of political considerations, and China has so far paid more attention to the great progress and achievements of its country.
Fourth, the challenge of "small bullying". In world politics, a big country may use its greater size and ability to bully a small country. But there is also the opposite situation - the small Congress uses its own relative weakness, because the reaction from the big country will cause international condemnation. For example, several small countries in the South China Sea dispute have gradually consolidated their occupation of controversial islands and reefs, and China is still more restrained. As China seeks to continue to rise, the complex reactions of big and small countries should be an important diplomatic issue.
Last but not least is the danger of too much praise. Overconfidence can hinder China's true and clear positioning of its position and image, especially when the outside world believes that the United States is in relative decline and may begin to "retreat", at least from the retreat of the global stage in which the United States' previous leadership has not been challenged. In fact, the United States still seeks to maintain its leadership position, and China should clearly recognize the relationship between its rising power and its responsibilities as a rising power. ?

US media: What role should Beijing be in the multilateral order?

US "National Interests" website June 20th article, original title: Without reform and cooperation with China, the international system will be difficult to maintain in Washington, people are increasingly forming a consensus that trying to integrate China into the multilateral international order Failed. Scholars say that carrots and sticks have failed to affect China as expected. Such remarks reflect the disappointment of Western experts. The idea that China will take the lead of the United States and change its economy and politics has gone bankrupt. But in fact, this naive idea would not work. China is too strong to accept this approach passively; China is too big, has experienced "hunting" for hundreds of years, and wants to return to its proper place. Moreover, the division of the international order itself is by no means the fault of China. Today, the real problem is complicated: What role does the United States expect from an increasingly powerful China to shape the current multilateral order that is impacted?
Since the reform and opening up in the late 1970s, China has become more supportive of post-war order. China has also joined hundreds of important organizations, such as the United Nations and the World Trade Organization . China is gradually increasing its direct or indirect support for multilateral activities and norms and is committed to playing a bigger role in global governance. China has shown strong support in certain areas, such as actively participating in international economic management, peacekeeping, and responding to global security threats. In general, China's actions in the post-cold-war era basically supported the international system. For certain aspects of the international order, China has always opposed it, such as unilateral military intervention in the name of supporting humanitarian values. However, in this respect, not only Beijing has an objection. More broadly, China's doubts generally do not touch the core rules of the international order.
In the past 30 years, China's international behavior has generally supported multilateral order, but in recent years China has become aggressive. The transformation of Beijing reflects to some extent the reality that the gap in national power between China and the United States has narrowed, which has intensified the strategic competition between the two major powers. However, China-US competition inevitably does not mean that it cannot cooperate with Beijing for a common international order, nor does it mean that such cooperation has no potential value. The current global system has withstood tremendous challenges and it is indispensable to seek cooperation with China on common concerns. Working with China, the United States and its allies and partners can also help shape a multilateral system that will ultimately bring greater influence to the United States.
In the process, the United States can seek opportunities to participate in China-led institutions and demonstrate flexibility in expanding China's participation in the institutions led by the United States and its allies.
China's initiatives, such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the "Belt and Road", can also be an opportunity for the US to participate in and change relevant standards and systems. Similarly, Washington can try to ensure that China has a fair voice in relevant organizations created in Western countries. The simple fact is that without a minimum of Chinese acquiescence, a rule-based international order cannot survive. Reform is inevitable, so that Beijing's concerns can be resolved and China's interests are related to the international order. ? (by Timothy Heath, Michael Mazar, translated by Joe Heng)

It's time for the United States to make historical choices.

The US government has recently issued the "National Security Strategy Report" and the "Defense Strategy Report", which together list China and Russia as "strategic competitors" and put China and Russia at the top of the US national security threat. President Trump's State of the Union address this year is clearly worded, saying that China has challenged US interests, economies and values. What do these reports and statements mean for the US China policy and the entire foreign policy? What changes have been made to the fundamentals of Sino-US relations? These all require us to calm down and think deeply.
The relationship between the major powers in international relations is of the utmost importance, because the relationship between the major powers determines the future of world peace and development, determines whether the international order can be smoothly adjusted, forms a new stable structure, and determines whether global governance can overcome "disorder" and "fragmentation" and continue to The international community provides suitable public goods. In today's great power relations, Sino-US relations are the core relationship of "taking the lead and moving the whole body."
Today, with the deepening of globalization, China and the United States have formed a symbiotic coexistence pattern regardless of economic or political and security interests. At the same time, the two sides have different ideologies and strategic orientations, and differences in political systems, domestic governance, and development models have always existed. China's rapid development in recent decades has provided a new development model, especially the economic reform plan that is completely "privatized, market-oriented, liberalized" represented by the "Washington Consensus" in the West. For the United States, this kind of challenge is unprecedented, and it is inevitable that strategic anxiety will arise. In general, the fundamentals of Sino-US relations in which these cooperation and competition coexist and cooperation are dominant will not change. This is the premise and background for us to observe Sino-US relations.
The question now is, in the face of the rising historical trend of China and the vast number of developing countries, what kind of strategic choices should the United States adapt to and adjust? Will it choose confrontation and conflict because "fear" is "replaced"? The United States has not given an answer to this question. From a macro perspective, the United States has not formed a pattern of comprehensive confrontation with China at the level of national policy, but at least some people and interest groups have suffered from this unfounded "phobia." Moreover, this "fear" is eroding the US policy toward China, and its manifestation is to strengthen the containment in the hands of cooperation and containment.
For the United States, long-term hegemonic status has solidified its "American peace under the control" mode of thinking, that is, the US as a "beacon on the mountain" of Western civilization superiority, the absolute military superiority of dominating the world, the dollar system that dominates the world's financial dominance, The status of a strong economic and trade country that is unique in the world will never allow anyone to challenge. Whether it is the Democratic Party or the Republican Party, the successive US governments and elites have not concealed this.
Of course, the United States also has been a intellectual knots untied, it is beautiful country to build the core concept of the country's "liberal" ideology and the United States two centuries of hegemony by force, plunder and power to establish "empire" included In many ways, they are contradictory and even antagonistic. The United States cannot be self-explanatory. Therefore, the international system and the global governance system that it promotes are all based on the pragmatic standpoint of "combining, not abandoning" and double standards.
This mode of thinking makes the United States to China's development and growth rather tangled, although China is in the United National Developmentpeaceful development of the international system stand up and driven globalization, and anyone without prejudice and malicious all know, China There is no strategic intent to challenge the United States and even replace it.
In the past, the United States successfully dealt with the Soviet Union, Japan, and Germany by means of the Cold War, the hot war, political isolation, and economic suppression. It is now encircling Russia and squeezing its strategic space. The victory of the Cold War has made the United States incomprehensible, and believes that the Western civilization and its political system and development model it dominated reached its peak. This is the so-called "American moment." This may be the most glorious moment of the United States' hegemony in the past 100 years. It is not known that it is fleeting, so short-lived, because the development of history has its own objective laws. The United States is still a world hegemonic country, but economic globalization and world multi-polarization continue to advance. The world power structure is also developing in a more balanced and more favorable direction for developing countries. The emergence of the first East-West power since the Western Industrial Revolution Convergence." Faced with this change, the United States has become "fragile" and has increased its strategic anxiety toward countries such as China. Now, it is time for the United States to make historical choices.
In fact, it is the choice of two roads: one is to choose peaceful coexistence, peaceful competition, maintain the existing global governance system and make appropriate adjustments; the second is to continue the "old routine" to deal with the rise of other big powers, using various means to suppress, Contain and maintain the long-term hegemonic status of the United States. At present, the United States has not yet made a comprehensive choice, but many practices are affected by the solidified thinking mode, inertia and instinctively acting in accordance with the "old routine." As early as the beginning of this century, the United States faced the choice of how to get along with China. Later, because of "global anti-terrorism," it had to postpone the "great power threat." Now that the "great power threat" has returned to the top of the US strategic threat, China has also been "putted first with Russia."
Today, with the deepening of globalization and the increasing interdependence of countries in the world, Sino-US relations not only affect the two countries themselves, but also directly affect world peace and prosperity. As a responsible big country, China has clearly made the statement that "cooperation is the only option" and hopes that the United States can make opposing choices based on in-depth discussions and serious thinking. As long as the United States makes the right choice, the prospects for Sino-US cooperation are infinite, and the prospects for world peace and development are infinite. ?

In-depth report
International conference is too lacking "Chinese voice"

From February 15th to 17th, the author's Global Think Tank (CCG) was invited to participate in the security conference held in Munich and hosted the sub-forum for the first time. The three-day period made the author feel the current world's general concern about China's topic and the mismatch between China's interpretation of the voice in an uncertain environment.
Before the opening of the Mu Anhui, the annual safety report "Global Puzzle: Who will fight the pieces?" ", mentioning that the global order is being reshuffled, and the rise of China is considered to be the key to the reorganization of the new global order. Therefore, the topic of "China's Challenges and Responses" was discussed by the participating NATO countries and traditional allies in Europe and the United States. They preconceived that China would become a "challenger" rather than a "builder."
At least seven or eight of the official side meetings of the conference directly involved Chinese topics, including the South China Sea dispute, the rise of China and the transatlantic alliance, the global influence of China's soft power, the "threat" brought about by China's network technology security, and the China Regional Initiative. Remodeling with the changing order of the world, the "Belt and Road" and the Indo-Pacific strategy, and the NATO defense. But the author found a surprising situation: the Chinese issue far exceeds the Chinese guests who will participate. In addition to the "One Belt and One Road": China, EU and '16+1 Cooperation' seminar was hosted by the Chinese, and another South China issue was attended by two Chinese experts. Other official side seminars on Chinese topics were held. There is no official Chinese research guest.
Visiting other sub-meeting rooms, even if it is not a Chinese-themed side event, will often mention China, and there are widespread misunderstandings and stereotypes about China, but few can give concrete and convincing cases and data support. . Because no Chinese are present, this negative sentiment is more likely to spread and deepen, and form an atmosphere. This lack of opportunity also makes China not have the opportunity to refute or explain, which is unfavorable for international understanding.
In the "Belt and Road" sub-forum, Ron Johnson, chairman of the US Senate Homeland Security Committee, unceremoniously "fired", claiming that China is forcing foreign companies to transfer technology, stealing intellectual property rights, and accusing China of unfair trade. The Chinese guests at the meeting pointed out that the protection of intellectual property rights in China was stronger than ever. At the same time, the issue of technology transfer proposed by the US was strongly refuted by the data of the American Chamber of Commerce. Finally, the expression of China and the United States should be resolved by dialogue rather than confrontation. The problem between the two great powers. While responding strongly to the challenges of the United States, the audience also learned about China's progress and position.
Outside the venue is also an important stage for the Chinese voice. The importance of Chinese think tanks participating more in international conferences is also reflected here. Because the meeting place of the Muhei Club is only located in the Bavarian Manor Hotel in Munich, the hotels with small space are very crowded. Heads of state, defense chiefs, foreign ministers and scholars are always at breakfast and in the elevator, which is also for us and people from all over the world. Communication provides plenty of room. Many politicians and think tanks also used the meeting as a good opportunity for bilateral meetings and exchanges. For example, before the participants attended the meeting, they received an invitation from the newly elected President of the German CDU, Kramp Karenbauer. During the meeting, they met with us.
With China's current international status and strength, every move will have an important impact on the world. We need to actively enter the international community, especially in the Western discourse system, to eliminate misunderstandings, enhance understanding, achieve cooperation, and avoid confrontation. These tasks require more subjects to go out and speak for a pluralistic, peaceful and constructive China. ? (The author is the deputy director and secretary general of the Global Think Tank [CCG])

In an exclusive interview with Xinhua News Agency , Serbian Defense Minister Alexander Wulin, who attended the 8th Beijing Xiangshan Forum , expressed his hope to continue to strengthen military friendly cooperative relations with China and jointly promote global governance toward a more just and orderly progress. Serbia is known as the "country that stands at the crossroads of Europe" because of its strategic location. In the martial arts view, although the geographical distance between the two countries is far away, they all face the same challenges. "Protectionism, unilateralism, international order and international rules are facing challenges. These are very dangerous tendencies." Wulin said that the international community should no longer return to the old track of weak meat and violence, but should The rule of law is the benchmark to regulate the behavior of all parties and seek the greatest common denominator of mutual benefit. "China upholds the principle of treating each other as equals and is a staunch force for maintaining the international order. It also vividly reflects the diplomatic wisdom of 'doing what you don't want to do.'" "mutual trust and mutual understanding, defending the international order, and promoting multipolarization." The peaceful development of the world, these common values ??allow us to connect with the distant Chinese heart," said Wulin.

"Serbians often say that they have a hard time seeing the truth. We will always feel the Chinese people's help during the special hard times in Serbia and express our sincerest gratitude to the Chinese government and people." In 2016, the heads of state of China and Serbia agreed to the relationship between the two countries.

In July this year, the military of the two countries unanimously agreed to expand mutual support and cooperation in high-level exchanges, personnel training, military medical care and other aspects. Wulin hopes that the military of the two countries will promote cooperation to a higher level and a wider scope based on different advantages and experiences.

?Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 28 (Reporter Wang Bin, Wu Jialin) In a special interview with Xinhua News Agency on the 28th, a multi-national political politician said that fair and open multilateralism is the correct way to solve the challenges facing the world today and in the future. On the same day, the 35th annual meeting of the International Action Council opened in Beijing, and former political leaders from more than 20 countries and regions around the world attended the opening ceremony. Climate change, financial crisis, immigration issues... A series of global issues have transcended national borders and affected the lives of every ordinary person. Former Uruguayan President Luis Alberto Lakale believes that for large and small countries, multilateral institutions such as the World Trade Organization have promoted global governance and common development in a peaceful manner. "Global issues require global solutions. Many members of the International Action Council believe that no country or region can solve global problems on its own." Former Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern said that the international order and international institutions It should better reflect today's economic reality. Regarding the impact of internationalism on the rise of protectionism and unilateralism, Bertie Ahern said that the international system based on treaties and the rule of law, although not perfect, is the key to solving the problem. "This system should not be attacked or weakened by malicious people. I firmly believe that dialogue and consultation is the right way to resolve conflicts." Former Guinean Prime Minister Kabine Komara said that in the past five years, the "Belt and Road" initiative has put more Funds and technology have been brought to Africa, a continent that has been "forgotten." "China's development is an opportunity for the African continent." He said that China's related multilateralism initiative is Yili.The embodiment of mutual aid is a powerful signal for building a community of human destiny. Former Hungarian Prime Minister Majestic Peter recalled the reception of the visiting Chinese delegation in the 1970s and 1980s and spoke highly of China's efforts to reform and open up and actively integrate into economic globalization. "From the changing world of Chinese people's lives and China's important contribution to global growth, the process of reform and opening up is a vivid practice that promotes the common prosperity and development of China and related countries," he said.

Xinhua News Agency Beijing 4 Yue 5 - Title: China firmly safeguards the international trade rules ??Xinhua News Agency reporters Zheng Mingda Meiguo recently released a list of recommendations taxed products to China 301 investigation. In this regard, China has decisively made a rational, powerful and knotted counterattack, which is not only defending its legitimate interests, but also maintaining international trade rules and showing the image of a responsible big country. The Chinese side has always been firm in its response to the trade friction between China and the United States. The position is clear: to fight, to accompany the end; to talk, the door is wide open. Anyone with a discerning eye can see that the current counter-attacks in China are enforceable, reasonable, and restrained. There are also transparent and non-discriminatory opening to the outside world. China is an active participant, a staunch supporter and an important contributor to the multilateral trading system. In the past 40 years of reform and opening up, the opening of China's opening has become more and more open, and the opening measures have brought more and more development opportunities to the world. In this regard, the international community is well known and highly appreciated. On the other hand, the United States, in disregarding the essence of mutual benefit and win-win cooperation between China and the United States in the past 40 years, adopting the 301 investigation of this typical unilateralism and trade protectionism, seriously violates the basic principles and spirit of the WTO . Especially when the foundation of the current global economic recovery is still weak, it is extremely irresponsible to provoke a trade war for one's own self and necessarily involve others. No one believes in no one, and no country in the country is weak. At present, the more unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise, the more we must listen to the voice of reason, follow the rules of international law and international trade, and actively adopt pragmatic measures to adapt to the wave of globalization. Condescending, unilateral coercion, overwhelming price, and entanglement are destined to fail; mutual respect, equal treatment, mutual understanding and mutual accommodation, and deserving and giving, are a win-win situation. In response to trade protectionism, China has measures and methods. Together with the international community, we face challenges. China has wisdom and solutions. China will always be the staunch defender of the current international trade rules and international order, and strive to build a community of human destiny. (Finish)

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 1st: Interview: The world needs the concept of international relations advocated by China - Interview with Russian scholar Tafrovsky
Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhang Jiye
In the history of China, the sages pursued the true meaning of interpersonal and inter-state exchanges in the word "and". China's adherence to the principle of "harmony and wealth" and "mutual benefit and win-win" international relations and global governance are now emerging worldwide, smearing the value orientation of self-interest and utilitarianism, bridging the gap caused by confrontation and conflict. "This is why China's global governance philosophy deserves to be carefully studied." Professor Tafrovsky of the Russian People's Friendship University said in an exclusive interview with Xinhua News Agency on the eve of the Chinese two sessions .
Speaking about the concept of international relations advocated by China, Tafrovsky said that in today's world, regional conflicts are frequent, new forms of interest are constantly confronted, and there is a lack of trust between countries. Therefore, the world needs a growing and powerful China to send out the voice of the original source. Gao Ming's diplomats will respect the five principles of peaceful coexistence advocated by China. The Eastern moral standards and values ??will eventually bear fruit in the international order.
Tafrovsky believes that the core of the concept of "co-industry, co-construction and sharing" proposed by China is to build more fair and reasonable international relations. In order to implement these principles in the international community, China has the courage to assume the "standard" responsibility.
Tafrovsky said that China advocates "the righteousness and the righteousness, and the righteousness first." China imports products from African countries, promotes the development of industrial agriculture, helps African countries build infrastructure, and provides African students with scholarships for top universities in China. China promotes the peripheral diplomatic concept of sincere and sincere support. In Central Asia, China maintains friendly cooperation with countries in the construction of large-scale agricultural water conservancy projects and transportation facilities to promote regional economic and technological development. In Southeast Asia, the relevant countries and China cooperate with each other. Road, railway and port construction projects are gradually being launched.
Tafrovsky believes that the "One Belt, One Road" initiative proposed by China is a concrete manifestation of "co-industry, joint construction, and sharing", and it is the continuation and development of the Chinese dream of realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
Tafrovsky said that he visited the "One Belt, One Road" node cities in Lianyungang and Zhengzhou in December last year. In Zhengzhou, he saw the train full of containers departing through Kazakhstan to Hamburg, Germany; in Lianyungang, the goods arrived at the Port of Rotterdam in the Netherlands via the New Eurasian Continental Bridge.
Tafrovsky lamented that the "Belt and Road" is of great significance and can help improve the infrastructure along the route, expand trade volume, promote technological development, create millions of new jobs, and ultimately improve the living standards of residents. More importantly, the "Belt and Road" will bring people's well-being and social development to the region, and will greatly reduce the possibility of regional conflicts.
Tavrovsky stressed that all the proposals in China are not mandatory, but are actively participated by other countries. This fully demonstrates that China advocates a "fairer and more rational international governance model." (Finish)

He also hopes that the reformed Chinese army can make greater contributions to safeguarding world peace and promoting common development.
Xi Jinping said that deepening national defense and military reform must focus on building elite combat forces, optimizing scale structure and force formation, and promoting the transformation of our army from quantity to quality.
Costa Rica's former foreign trade minister and former ambassador to China, Marco Ruiz, believes that the decision to reduce military posts is in line with China's principle of maintaining world peace and regional stability.
Russian media and analysts pointed out that while reducing the number of military personnel, China will pay more attention to the quality of military construction. China will focus on optimizing the structure of the military, improving the combat effectiveness of the military, and enhancing the quality of its personnel, and building an elite combat force.
Khalid Rahman, director of the Islamabad Policy Research Institute in Pakistan, said that when a country is disarmed, the reduced military power will be more effective and modern, and the Chinese army will be on the right path. The defense and military reform will strengthen the unified leadership of the Central Military Commission on the military, which will help the Chinese leadership to form a unified national security policy.
Russian experts analyzed that the defense and military reforms will greatly strengthen the unified coordination, command and management of the military commissions and military services of the Central Military Commission, and will be conducive to the effective use of modern weapons and equipment.
The US "New York Times" reported that China's plan to deepen its defense and military reforms highlights the breadth of China's push for military reform, marking a major step forward for the Chinese military to shift its focus from the traditional army to a more flexible and cohesive team.
Reuters, Japan's Kyodo News, "Sankei Shimbun" and "Tokyo News" and other overseas media reported on China's defense and military reform in a timely manner, arguing that the purpose of the Chinese military reform is to enhance the military's combat effectiveness and improve the quality and effectiveness of the military.
Zheng Yongnian, director of the East Asian Institute of the National University of Singapore, said that the reform of the Chinese military and China's strategic concerns are advancing with the times. China has a more effective, transparent and international army that can better cooperate with other countries in international cooperation, thereby enhancing mutual trust and maintaining international order. In addition, China is also more capable of sending peacekeeping troops to carry out peacekeeping operations and fight terrorism.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 14th: Active and promising, advancing the reform of the global governance system - Interpretation of Xi Jinping's speech during the twenty-seventh collective study of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee
Xinhua News Agency reporter Hou Lijun, Wu Yue
On the 12th, in the 27th collective study of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Xi Jinping, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, stressed that it is necessary to promote the development of a global governance system in a more just and rational direction and create more favorable conditions for China's development and world peace.
Experts said that the Politburo of the CPC Central Committee conducted a special study on the "global governance structure and global governance system" on the one hand because the changes in the international structure have put forward new requirements for global governance; on the other hand, it also shows that China hopes to have a global governance system. Make positive contributions to change.
(Subheading) Promoting a more just and fair global governance system
General Secretary Xi Jinping said in his study, it is a general trend to strengthen global governance and promote the reform of the global governance system. This is not only about responding to various global challenges, but also about setting rules and direction for the international order and the international system; it is not only about the struggle for the commanding heights of development, but also for the long-term institutional arrangements of countries in the international order and the international system. Status and role.
Zhang Yuyan, director of the Institute of World Economics and Politics of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said that global governance focuses on the formulation of international rules and the establishment of an international system. Peaceful coexistence and mutual benefit and win-win under the rules of fairness and equality are needed by all countries in the world. However, at present, the representation and voice of countries in the international governance system are not exactly the same.
"The developed countries are generally leading the process of global governance. Whoever leads the global governance process and formulates rules will definitely protect the interests of the people, so the rules formulated will be biased and not fair and reasonable." Zhang Yuyan said .
He said that the main problem of global governance at present is that the international discourse rights of developing countries, which account for more than 70% of the world's total population, do not match their own scale. Some developing countries hope that China can make more contributions to promoting a more just and reasonable global governance mechanism.
When Xi Jinping spoke at the United Nations Headquarters at the end of last month , he pointed out the "China path" for the reform of the international order: "China will continue to stand with the developing countries and firmly support the increase of developing countries, especially African countries, in the international governance system. Representation and voice."
Experts pointed out that China's continuous development has provided development opportunities for some developing countries and has become an important guarantee for promoting the development of the international system in a relatively balanced direction.
(Subheading) Contributing wisdom and power to global governance change
Over the past few decades, China has been down-to-earth to contribute wisdom and strength to the reform and improvement of the international order, and has firmly established itself as a "practice of peaceful development, a promoter of common development, a defender of the multilateral trading system, and a participant in global economic governance."
Xi Jinping said: We propose the "One Belt, One Road" initiative, establish a new type of international relations with cooperation and win-win as the core, adhere to the concept of correct righteousness and interests , and build a community of human destiny, conform to the trend of the times, conform to the interests of all countries, and increase the same Convergence points of national interests.
"An important diplomatic goal of China is to provide more public goods to the region and the international community, and to shoulder the responsibilities that can be achieved," said Cui Hongjian, director of the European Institute of China Institute of International Studies.
During his recent month at the series of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations, Xi Jinping announced a series of major initiatives. Experts say that these major policy announcements are China's new efforts to promote global development. As a permanent member of the Security Council, China actively participates in the actions of the United Nations in the world and embodies the responsibility of a responsible big country.
(Subheading) Promoting the development of global governance concepts
Xi Jinping pointed out that it is necessary to promote the innovation and development of global governance concepts, actively explore the positive ways of life and governance in Chinese culture, and resonate with the current era, continue to enrich the idea of ??building a community of human destiny, and promote the concept of global governance of mutual cooperation and sharing. .
Analysts pointed out that the trend of world multi-polarization, economic globalization, cultural diversity, and democratization of international relations is unstoppable, but the zero-and-opposing thinking of the Cold War and the arrogant "end of history" mentality are still in the international relations. Not going.
The requirements of global governance rules that reflect more fair and reasonable requirements are inseparable from the absorption of various excellent civilizations. The flower of human civilization is full of colors. Countries with different historical cultures, different national conditions, and different social systems should understand each other and treat each other with sincerity and be good at listening to each other's voices.
Cui Hongjian said that Chinese traditional culture is very instructive to the international system and pattern, as well as international coordination and development. "For example, we have proposed to establish a global partnership, and partners do not engage in alliances, which is to be discovered from the traditional wisdom of China."
Zhang Yuyan said that by taking advantage of the advantages and essence of Chinese traditional culture and injecting it into the concept of global governance, and seeking a mutually beneficial and win-win, fair and reasonable global governance, China can make a unique contribution. (Finish)

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 18th, Summary: Maintaining the post-war international order, China and the United States are duty-bound
Xinhua News Agency reporter Sun Ding Li Wei
After the end of World War II, the Allies, including China and the United States, established a post-war international order aimed at maintaining peace and preventing the restoration of militarism. When the international community celebrated the 70th anniversary of the victory of World War II, the Japanese right-wing forces continued to try to deny the victory of the Second World War and amend the "Peace Constitution," and the post-war order faced serious challenges.
In this regard, Chinese and foreign experts and scholars have called for China and the United States to join hands to defend the hard-won post-war international order.
Ted Carpenter, a senior researcher at the Kato Institute of Defense and Diplomacy, said in an interview with Xinhua News Agency that the United States should work with China as soon as possible to jointly safeguard post-war order. The close cooperation between China and the United States will play an active role in coping with a series of problems and stabilizing the situation.
(Subheading) The post-war order cannot be shaken
Born in the ruins of World War II, " Lian Geguo Xianzhang" is one of the main outcomes of victory of the world anti-fascist war, it is the cornerstone of post-war safeguard world peace and stability. The two important documents, the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation, laid the foundation for peace and order in East Asia today.
Yan Zongze, deputy dean of the China Institute of International Studies, believes that the international order after the Second World War was established based on these important historical documents. "The purpose of these documents is to better maintain world peace and prevent history from repeating the same mistakes."
The Cairo Declaration clearly stipulates that "Japan's territory stolen from China, such as the four northeastern provinces, Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, etc." must be returned to China. The Potsdam Proclamation is an ultimatum that urges Japan to surrender unconditionally. It reiterates that the conditions of the Cairo Declaration will be implemented, and Japan's sovereignty will be limited to the state, Hokkaido, Kyushu, Shikoku and ours. The island is inside."
Yin Hong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University of China and a State Council counselor, said: "These provisions are very clear: Japan must return Chinese territory that has been forced by force, including the Diaoyu Islands."
After the complete acceptance of the Potsdam Proclamation, Japan began to implement the current constitution in 1947. The Constitution is called the "Peace Constitution" because of its Article 9 stipulation that Japan will forever renounce the war, the threat of force or the use of force launched by the state power as a means of resolving international disputes. The Constitution also prohibits Japan from maintaining the sea, land, air force and other war forces, and "does not recognize the right of the country to fight." Japanese scholars pointed out that the "Peace Constitution" is a commitment made by Japan to the world after summing up the lessons of war.
The "Peace Constitution" is actually part of the United States' participation in Japan's post-war reconstruction. Like other historical documents signed by victors such as China, the purpose of this constitution is to ensure that Japan's defeated imperialist countries concentrate their resources on reviving the economy and put an end to its war of aggression.
Yang Xiyu, a researcher at the China Institute of International Studies, said: "At the time, China and the United States launched very sincere cooperation on the Japanese issue and laid a good foundation for building a new international order."
(Subheading) Japan openly challenges post-war order
Just a few years after the adoption of the "Peace Constitution," Japan attempted to cover up aggression and war crimes in its history textbooks, marking a gradual decline in Japan's commitment to abandon its right to war.
For decades, Japanese cabinet members have defied the Potsdam Proclamation and have continued to pay homage to the Yasukuni Shrine, which includes 14 World War II Class-A war criminals. Ruan Zongze pointed out that the Yasukuni Shrine, a symbol of Japanese militarism, also enshrined some war criminals who were responsible for Japan's sneak attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. Under the connivance of the United States, Japan is more unscrupulously challenging the post-war international order.
Under the instigation of the current Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the Japanese government tried to amend the "Peace Constitution" and forced the passage of the controversial new security bill, so that the Japanese Self-Defense Forces broke through the "defense of defense" and played a "bigger role" overseas. This is another farce that the Japanese authorities staged after the announcement of the "nationalization" of the Diaoyu Islands.
Zhai Zongze believes that Japan openly challenges the current international order, and its purpose is to break the restrictions imposed on it by the international community after the war, which reflects the "historical revisionism of Japan."
Security-related bills, which were called public opinion by the Japanese domestic public opinion and the international community, were strongly opposed once they were announced. A recent poll by the Japan Broadcasting Association (NHK) showed that 61% of respondents expressed opposition to the Abe regime. In addition, large-scale protests against the security bill have occurred in major cities in Japan.
Yang Xiyu believes that "If the security system is revised, the world will see a Japanese that can use force overseas and have uncertainty." Such a Japan will pose a serious threat to the Asia-Pacific region and the world, and will also bring to the United States. Huge uncertainty and challenges.
Tang Zhongnan, honorary president of the China Society of Japanese History, published in the magazine Qiushi, that today's Japan is strikingly similar to Germany after World War I, and the international community must be very vigilant. He said that in the 1930s, Germany tore up the Treaty of Versailles and became the source of World War II. Today, Japan is attempting to overthrow the "Peace Constitution", and its approach is the same as that of Germany in the past, which shows that Japan is challenging and denying post-war order.
(Subheading) China and the United States work together to maintain the world order
China and the United States are allies who fought side by side in World War II and were builders, defenders and contributors to the post-war international order.
Teng Jianqun, director of the Institute of American Studies at the China Institute of International Studies, believes that peace and stability brought about by post-war order are necessary prerequisites for the development of China and the United States. Maintaining good Sino-US relations is in the interest of the two peoples. He said that thanks to the relatively stable external environment, China has become the engine of global economic growth, and after the financial crisis, the economic development of the United States relied heavily on the Asia-Pacific region. Therefore, maintaining peace, stability and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region is the biggest meeting point of interest between China and the United States.
Cui Tiankai, the Chinese ambassador to the United States, published a signed article in the USA Today newspaper saying that China has achieved tremendous development by adhering to the path of peaceful development, promoting reform and opening up to the outside world. "China is the beneficiary and defender of the current international order."
Yang Xiyu believes that the United States is actually the biggest beneficiary of the post-war order of the Second World War. By cooperating with other World War II victors to establish post-war order, the United States has consolidated its position as one of the leading forces in international affairs, enjoying peace and stability for most of the postwar period, creating the need for decades of economic prosperity. condition. In this sense, it is necessary for the United States to join hands with China, which plays a role in maintaining post-war order, to maintain stability and sustainability.
(Subheading) China and the United States maintain a huge space for post-war order cooperation
Cui Tiankai pointed out that China and the United States should transcend their differences, commit themselves to safeguarding the core values ??and basic framework of post-war order, and resolutely oppose the act of denying and challenging the outcome of the Second World War.
Stephen Ollens, chairman of the US-China Relations Committee , said in an interview with Xinhua News Agency that the United States and China should expand bilateral cooperation on a series of issues such as search and rescue, humanitarian assistance, climate change prevention, counter-terrorism and finance.
As an important part of consolidating the post-war international order, the international financial order and economic order also need China and the United States - as the largest developing country and the largest developed country, and the world's top two economies, working together and maintain.
Yang Xiyu said that some bilateral agreements and mechanisms between China and the United States will make great contributions to safeguarding post-war order, such as the Sino-US bilateral investment agreement that is under negotiation. He said that the Sino-US bilateral investment agreement has broad regional and global significance and will become a benchmark for big countries to join hands to consolidate post-war order.
In the multilateral arena, the world relies on China and the United States to play a role in addressing issues related to global security, because the world is becoming a "community of destiny."
Teng Jianqun said that in addition to cooperation on traditional security issues, cooperation between China and the United States on non-traditional security concerns such as peacekeeping, counter-terrorism, nuclear non-proliferation, cybersecurity, climate change and energy also needs to strengthen interaction.
During the visit of the special envoy of President Xi Jinping, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Secretary of the Central Political and Legal Committee Meng Jianzhu, China and the United States reached important consensus on combating cybercrime and provided an opportunity for China and the United States to strengthen cooperation in this field.
Teng Jianqun said that under the new situation, the two countries must have new thinking and take new actions to further safeguard world peace and stability. (End) (Participating in reporters: Qi Wei, Liao Zhenyun, Guan Jianwu, Caring Guo, Liu Li, Shang Yang)

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 25th, Commentary: The cornerstone of the post-war international order cannot be shaken
Xinhua News Agency reporter Chen Cong
On July 26, 70 years ago, an important document that laid the foundation for the post-war international order was published in the Potsdam Proclamation. Looking back on the past, after revisiting this history after 70 years, it is still deeply meaningful and significant.
The publication of the Potsdam Proclamation expresses the firm determination to fight against the fascist aggressors who attempted to conquer the world "not to stop resisting"; the publication of the announcement accelerated the demise of Japanese militarism and expressed "permanent rejection" of its "poor soldiers" The distinctive attitude of the doctrine; the publication of the announcement, together with a series of international documents such as the Cairo Declaration, became the cornerstone of the post-war international order and an important international law document that Japan must abide by.
According to the Potsdam Proclamation, Japan carried out democratic reforms and implemented a peaceful constitution. The legal basis for the survival of Japanese militarism was deprived, the military ambition of the Japanese right-wing forces was contained, and the direction of Japan's pursuit of peaceful development was established after the war. It is precisely because of this foundation that Japan can be re-admitted by the international community after the war, and Japan will be able to open a peaceful and friendly process with neighboring countries, and Sino-Japanese relations can also open the door to normalization.
However, it is regrettable that the documents such as the Potsdam Proclamation and the Cairo Declaration have long been hated by Japanese right-wing forces. Especially in recent years, a small number of right-wing forces in Japan have begun to rise, distorting and falsifying history, trampling on international jurisprudence, and attempting to incite the cornerstone of the achievements of World War II. Illegal purchase of Diaoyu Islands, frequent visits to the Yasukuni Shrine for the Class A war criminals, and the lifting of the ban on collective self-defense rights, such as ugly dramas and farce dramas. The actions of the Japanese right-wing forces, contrary to the spirit of the Potsdam Proclamation, are a serious betrayal of Japan's post-war international commitments, a public challenge to the post-war international order, and a source of tension in East Asia.
The Potsdam Proclamation was regarded as the "origin of Japan after the war" in Japan. The official Japanese translation has been compiled into the "Japanese Diplomatic Instruments" and deposited in the Constitutional Reference Room of the National Library of Japan. Any registered readers can access the original microfilm information.
Ironclad is like a mountain. But what is remarkable is that in the debate on the party's first party on May 20 this year, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe actually refused to explicitly recognize the "Potsdam Proclamation"'s characterization of the Japanese war of aggression, and said that he did not read the announcement. As the prime minister of a country, especially the prime minister of a defeated country, the history of aggression against the country turned out to be such an attitude, undoubtedly revealing that its conscience has been distorted, losing its sense of reverence for history and shame for aggression.
Former Federal German President Weizsek once said: "Whoever does not look at history will blindly obey the reality. Who is not willing to reflect on atrocities, whoever may repeat the same mistakes in the future." The deep-rooted morbid history of the Japanese right-wing forces has made the international community more and more aware of the serious consequences of the right-wing trains running wild.
The refusal to recognize the Potsdam Proclamation means challenging the international order. Japan's former Foreign Affairs Department's head of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Asai Kee, pointed out that Japan's abandonment of war and its complete unarmedness constituted the basis of the East Asian peaceful international order after World War II. And Abe's words and deeds are undoubtedly a challenge to the Potsdam Proclamation and the international order. They will not only abduct their own people in dangerous chariots, but will also affect peace in the region and the world.
The refusal to recognize the Potsdam Proclamation means subverting the cornerstone of peace. It is in the premise of acknowledging the "Potsdam Proclamation" that Japan was able to recover quickly and develop rapidly after the war, and destroying this cornerstone will undoubtedly destroy its own future and ruin itself. As Professor Minho Nakayama of the Japan Society of Clausewitz said, Abe's actions are putting Japan on the road of endangering the country's peace and subverting the society. "This is a road to no return against the world and the trend of the times."
"At present, Japan has to decide a way. It will continue to be wrongly calculated by its own intentions, so that the Japanese empire is in the control of the military in complete destruction, or to the path of reason." The words of the Potsdam Proclamation 70 years ago It is still alarming to read today.
History cannot be tampered with, and the cornerstone is instigated! Once militarism resurfaces, it is endless. At the juncture of the future of humanity, all peace-loving people should learn from history and build a solid dam of peace and justice to defend the important cornerstone of maintaining international order.

Zhang Yesui said that China's overall views and evaluations of the post-war international order are positive. China is a participant, builder and contributor to the current international order and international system. We advocate maintaining the international order centered on the United Nations after the Second World War , and at the same time reforming the existing international order in accordance with the development of the situation, promoting the democratization of international relations, legalizing international governance, safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of developing countries, and promoting the establishment of cooperation and mutual benefit.

Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, February 5th: China is willing to become a reformer of the international order - Interview with Chinese Ambassador to Belgium
Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhou Wei Ban Yi
The 51st Munich Security Conference will be held from February 6th to 8th in the southern German city of Munich. Qu Xing, the Chinese ambassador to Belgium and former president of the China Institute of International Studies, said that looking at the global security landscape, non-traditional security threats are becoming more and more urgent, but peace and development are still the basic characteristics. China hopes to become a reformer of the international order.
(Subheading) Non-traditional security threats aggravate
Hot issues in the international security arena, such as the Ukrainian crisis and terrorism, are the focus of the meeting. Qu Xing believes that the coexistence of traditional and non-traditional threats is a prominent problem in today's international security situation. The confrontation between the DPRK and the ROK, the eastern Ukraine in the hot war and the Russia and the United States behind the new Cold War can show that the traditional security issues surrounding territorial and sovereignty have not been resolved, and the related conflicts are in danger of expanding and spreading.
However, non-traditional security threats are more serious and urgent, especially the threat of terrorism in the Middle East. Qu Xing said that in the Middle East, external intervention has promoted drastic changes in the Middle East. After the original balance was broken, it failed to build a new order. As an important energy source and transportation hub in the world, the Middle East chaos has severely affected regional and global security, and the threat of terrorism has risen. The Paris terrorist attack is a typical example. Many European countries are currently in a state of high-level alert, and the security situation is very serious.
Qu Xing emphasized that terrorism is the public enemy of the international community. All countries should cooperate and strike together. China is also a victim of terrorism. China has always participated in anti-terrorism international cooperation and fulfilled its international responsibilities with active cooperation.
The Munich Security Conference will also discuss non-traditional security issues such as energy, the environment, the Ebola outbreak, and the Internet. Qu Xing believes that the above-mentioned security issues have attracted the attention of all international parties: in the context of globalization, the prevention and control of Ebola diseases increasingly need to be tackled globally; the concentration of nuclear power plants in Europe is a worrying issue of nuclear safety; this year Paris A World Climate Conference will also be held to discuss the impact of climate change on human survival.
(Subheading) Strengthening dialogue and abandoning force
Qu Xing believes that each country has its own basic national conditions. Foreign interference in the use of force and subversion of a country's original political power will lead to unpredictable consequences.
Qu Xing said that Iraq did not participate in the record of international terrorist activities in the past, nor did it have room for international extremism to survive. But now the extremist organization "Islamic State" has found a breeding ground in Iraq. This is precisely the problem of the big countries dealing with the region. It was too rash to use force to undermine the evil consequences of the original political structure.
"If there is any historical lesson worthy of learning, it is that a big country cannot intervene in a domestic policy with its own value standards and easily use force. Otherwise, the problems caused by it will be more serious and complicated than the problem to be solved," Qu Xing said.
When talking about the Ukrainian issue, Qu Xing said that big countries should play a role in advancing the process of reconciliation. However, the current trend is worrying. The United States has proposed to consider providing weapons of destruction to Ukraine. The competition of big countries can only complicate the crisis situation.
Qu Xing said that China believes that foreign interference is not conducive to reconciliation, that military means cannot be used to achieve long-term stability, and that all parties concerned should achieve reconciliation through negotiation and consultation, first stop the conflict and solve the problem through the most fundamental way of dialogue. China, Russia, and Ukraine are all friendly countries. We hope that the situation will be calm as soon as possible, the nation will achieve reconciliation, and conflicts will stop.
(Subheading) China is willing to be a reformer
Qu Xing believes that although the contradictions among the major powers are still fierce, overall, the relations between the major powers are basically stable, there is no conflict or war, and the great powers show willingness to cooperate. They can resolve conflicts and conduct games through diplomatic negotiations, peace and harmony. Development is still a basic feature of the modern era.
Qu Xing said that after the Cold War, Yalta system does not end, the United Nations basic principles and decision-making mechanisms of the Charter is still valid, but the United States a superpower, almost unchecked, and thus lead to many problems, the international system has changed. At the same time, the group rise of developing countries is also a prominent feature today, and giving developing countries a right to speak in line with their status is the core of the reform of the international system.
Qu Xing said that in the Second World War before the establishment of the Yalta system, the Chinese made great sacrifices, which established China's international status and became an important member of the post-war international system. After China resumed its seat in the United Nations , especially since the reform and opening up, China has developed under the existing international system. Therefore, China does not require the overthrow of the system. Qu Xing said that China hopes to become a reformer of the international order, not a "revolutionary." (Finish)

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 3 (Reporter Xiong Zhengyan) Major General Qian Lihua, member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and former director of the Foreign Affairs Office of the Ministry of National Defense, said on the 3rd that the possibility of a firearm in the East Asia region cannot be completely ruled out, but this does not depend on In China. The Chinese army will not hit the first shot, but if someone picks the first shot and imposes conflict and war on China, China will respond vigorously.
This year marks the 120th anniversary of the Sino-Japanese War, the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of the First World War, and the 75th anniversary of the outbreak of the Second World War. Japanese militarism is on the rise, and the Abe regime has been moving frequently. Some media believe that Abe is taking Japan to a dangerous road.
(Subheading) Some right-wing forces deliberately create a war atmosphere
"History will not repeat itself." Qian Lihua said in an interview with Xinhua News Agency that some people compare the current East Asian situation to the 19th century British-German contradiction, or to the British-American contradiction in the late 19th century. accurate. Because the situation in Asia is very different from the situation in Europe, the situation in the 21st century is quite different from the situation in the 19th century. A simple analogy will inevitably mislead the society and mislead the people.
"Why do some people in the world create and render the atmosphere of war?" Qian Lihua said that some right-wing forces deliberately create a war atmosphere, interfere with the determination and will to undermine our normal economic and social development.
Qian Lihua said that Japan is restless and the country has lost its direction, opening the door for Japan's right-wing forces. Japan's right-wing forces have become popular and attempted to challenge the international order formed after World War II, making Japan a "normal country". Japan has a correct understanding of history and must handle relations with other countries.
(Subheading) China has the ability and means to restrict Japan
Since the Sino-Japanese War of 1894, Japan has interrupted China's development twice. Is it possible for Japan to take risks again and interrupt China's peaceful development for the third time?
Qian Lihua said that China today is not China in 1894, nor China in the 1930s. Whether it is Japan's right-wing forces or militaristic forces, it has caused great trouble, chaos, conflict, and even a certain scale of warfare to China. This is impossible and will not become a reality.
"The Chinese army and the Chinese people have the ability and means to restrict the development of Japanese militarism and check and balance some of the problems and troubles that Japan has constantly created around us." He said that China must seriously deal with the problems and contradictions between China and Japan and control the crisis. Avoiding the crisis becoming a conflict, bringing Sino-Japanese relations back to the right track, and ensuring that China will not be disturbed and interrupted by any wrong judgment or misjudgment of Japan.
(Subheading) If there is war, it will destroy the world economic recovery.
Qian Lihua said that no matter China, the United States, or Japan, there is no hope for war. After all, the current international trend is still peace and development. Now that all countries' economies are in a certain difficulty, they all hope to get rid of the economic difficulties as soon as possible and put the country on a normal development path. "In this case, if a war breaks out, it will only destroy the economic recovery that has just begun to pick up."
"But we are not afraid of war. The Chinese have suffered imperialist aggression many times in history and suffered a huge national disaster. But today's Chinese army, today's Chinese people, are no longer the Chinese army and people in the period of poverty and weakness. Qian Lihua said that the purpose of preparing for the military is to fight and stop war. Only by fully preparing can we stop the war, prevent conflicts, resolve threats, and avoid war.
(Subheading) Hope that Japanese leaders do not take the country and the people astray
"The party that launched the war has never ended well. As an island country, Japan, as a country with extremely scarce resources, if it wants to launch a war, the first thing it will suffer is its own." Qian Lihua said that if Japan joins other countries to launch an empty sea against China. The war of one-piece war or offshore control, the blockade of China, China can also carry out anti-blockade.
He said that the war is the national political will, and the competition is the national strength. "We have surpassed Japan in terms of population size, national economic strength, or comprehensive national strength including military strength."
Qian Lihua said that China and Japan are neighbors across the sea. China and Japan have a history of exchanges of two thousand years. Although there have been misfortunes between the two countries, especially the half-century after the Sino-Japanese War. I hope that this tragedy will not repeat itself. I hope that the Japanese leaders will not take the country and the people astray. (Finish)

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 4 (Reporter Wang Huihui) This year marks the 35th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the United States. The Sino-US relations seminar on the theme of building a new-type relationship between China and the United States was held in Beijing on the 4th. The participants believed that it is a realistic possibility for China and the United States to build a new type of big power relationship. I believe that the relationship between the two countries can continue to maintain peace.
In 1978, Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping and US President Carter negotiated across the Pacific Ocean, which eventually led to the official establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries on January 1, 1979. In the past 35 years, relations between the two countries have gone through the ups and downs, but the overall development is forward.
(Subheading) The inevitable conflict of the rise of a great power is a false proposition
In June 2013, Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Barack Obama held a historic meeting at the Annaberg Manor in the United States, reaching a consensus on building a new-type relationship between China and the United States that is "no conflict, no confrontation, mutual respect, cooperation and mutual benefit". The historical curse of the confrontation between the emerging powers and the defending powers.
"Many people are skeptical about the relationship between the new powers. The more prominent ones are offensive realists. They are very pessimistic about this. They point out that the rising powers in history have erupted military conflicts and wars between the big powers and the big countries. The relationship between big powers is not a realistic issue," said Jia Qingguo, a professor at the School of International Studies at Peking University .
"But history does not seem to be exactly the same." Jia Qingguo said that in the second half of the 19th century, the rise of the United States did not lead to a war between it and the great power of Britain, and the United Kingdom was not prepared to contain the rise of the United States. The rise of Japan and Germany after World War II was also peaceful, and there was no military conflict and war with the United States.
He said that the main reason is that these countries did not challenge the current international order in their rise, not through territorial expansion, but through trade to achieve their own overseas interests and international prestige, and they shared some values ??with the defending countries.
(Subheading) It is a realistic possibility for China and the United States to build a new type of big power relationship.
Jia Qingguo said that China's peaceful rise and the establishment of a new type of big power relationship between China and the United States are also a realistic possibility.
He said that China does not challenge the current international order. China is an important member and a staunch supporter and supporter of important international organizations such as the United Nations , the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund .
"China does not carry out territorial expansion. In the past few decades, the Chinese government and neighboring countries have negotiated border agreements and tried to fix their borders. Currently, neighboring countries outside India have solved the problem of land borders. China's problem in the South China Sea on the East China Sea The claim is also consistent, and has not expanded the scope." Jia Qingguo said.
He said that China is also achieving its international interests through international trade and raising its international prestige. The differences between China and the United States on the values ??of the market economy, the rule of law, and human rights have also been greatly reduced, although there are still many differences at the operational level.
(Subheading) "I hope Deng Xiaoping's dream - the harmonious coexistence of the two countries can be achieved"
The former witness of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the United States and former US President Carter are also full of confidence in the future of Sino-US relations. He said: "The future of US-China relations must be friendly and mutually supportive. This is beneficial to the two countries and the world. I hope Deng Xiaoping's dream - the harmonious coexistence of the two countries can be achieved, and this is my dream."
O'Brien, president of the US-China Relations Committee, said in his speech: "The decision of Carter and Deng Xiaoping on the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries was correct. In the past 35 years, we have seen a prosperous and peaceful foundation based on constructive Sino-US relations. Asia."
He said that today's economic relations between the two countries continue to prosper and investment and trade have increased rapidly. The leaders of the two countries have met many times and believe that US and Chinese leaders can follow the path of Carter and Deng Xiaoping to continue to maintain peace and stability in the Pacific for the next 35 years.
The US ambassador to China, Bocas, said that US-China relations are crucial bilateral relations. Both sides must ensure that they are on the right track. They hope that the United States and China can have healthy and lasting relationships, trust each other and solve problems through cooperation. (Finish)

As an emerging market power and a global stakeholder, the BRICS have the capacity and responsibility to provide a rational solution to global challenges.
Since the birth of "BRIC" as a new concept, it has developed into a cooperative mechanism led by regular meetings of leaders from five regional emerging market countries, including ministerial conferences, business forums, think tank forums and other communication and dialogue activities. . For more than 10 years, the BRICS countries have continued to strengthen dialogue, deepen cooperation, set up new development banks and emergency reserve arrangements, and gradually realized the transition from concept to entity, to promote world economic growth, reform and improve global economic governance, and promote democracy in international relations. Make an important contribution.
The BRICS countries are at a similar stage of development, bear similar historical missions, have the same development goals, and the BRICS countries have a large population, a large market, strong economic complementarity, and great potential for cooperation. Under the background of the current complicated international and regional changes and the long-term reliance of the world economic recovery, further deepening and expanding cooperation not only directly affects the development of the BRICS, but also the development of the world economy and the international order.
The first is to work together to create a BRICS national interest community. The "One Belt, One Road" major initiative proposed by President Xi Jinping in 2013 has been recognized and supported by more and more countries, and has also created important opportunities for the BRICS countries to expand their strategic cooperation space and enhance the level of pragmatic cooperation. Russia is an active supporter of the "Belt and Road Initiative". In May 2015, the heads of state of China and Russia signed a joint statement on the construction of the Silk Road Economic Belt and the construction of the Eurasian Economic Union. This fully demonstrates that the two countries have built a community of interests. Firm will. In addition, China's development strategies and regional cooperation plans with other BRICS countries are also in an orderly connection. China's investment and external capacity cooperation will help promote infrastructure construction and industrial transformation and upgrading of BRICS countries, and tighten the interests of countries and peoples. connected together.
The second is to work together to create a BRICS national action community. The BRICS countries are important countries in their respective regions and have a strong sense of responsibility. They hope to promote the establishment of a global governance structure based on the principle of multipolarity and reflecting the new world political and economic development. Only by uniting the BRICS can they have a substantial impact on the existing international landscape and the global governance system. Through regular meetings of leaders, the BRICS countries can exchange in-depth views on major international and regional issues, thereby carrying out more joint actions in international affairs , safeguarding the core position of the UN in international affairs, promoting the democratization of international relations, and promoting the world. Peace and development. The BRICS countries have worked hard to raise their voice and influence, and have sent a consistent signal to the world, playing an important role in improving global governance and strengthening multilateralism.
The third is to work together to create a BRICS national responsibility community. President Xi Jinping pointed out: "The BRICS countries are leaders in emerging market countries and developing countries, and are also important members of the G20 ." The world today is still very restless, and trade protectionism, hegemonism, and power politics have risen. The BRICS countries are obliged to safeguard the common interests of emerging market countries and developing countries on key issues of global governance such as climate change, IMF reform, counter-terrorism, transnational crime, and cybersecurity. As a major emerging market country and a global stakeholder, the BRICS have the ability and responsibility to provide reasonable solutions to global challenges and actively provide more public goods to the international community while doing their own thing.
In September, Xiamen gathered in the eyes of the world, and the ninth meeting of the BRICS leaders with the theme of "Deepening the BRICS Partnership and Opening a Brighter Future" was held soon. Since taking over the chairmanship of the BRICS countries, the Chinese side has made great efforts to lead the BRICS cooperation to a broader, deeper and more realistic goal, and strive to open the great voyage of the second "Golden Decade" of BRICS cooperation. I am convinced that as long as we continue to uphold the spirit of openness, tolerance, cooperation and win-win, and continue to deepen our partnership and enhance our cohesiveness and mobility, the BRICS cooperation will usher in a golden future.

The outside world has always been highly concerned about the Sino-Russian joint military exercise, especially the United States and Japan. However, the words "quasi-confederation" are used to describe Sino-Russian relations precisely because they have not jumped out of their "alliance circle." Because the United States and Japan are alliances, the United States has always used this relationship to look at the relations between other countries. The Sino-Russian military exercise is a routine military exercise, which is normal in any area. It is only because of the recent South China Sea issue that many Western countries, especially the United States and Japan, naturally associate two things together. This is "the belly of a gentleman with a heart of a villain." From their own perspective, they look at this Sino-Russian military exercise with their cold war mentality.
Nowadays, international relations are complicated, especially in the context of the fact that the South China Sea issue is constantly being confused by the strategic intention of the United States. The Sino-Russian joint military exercise actually shows the world the determination of the two countries to jointly safeguard peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region. It is reasonable and legal to conduct military exercises on possible conflicts and accidents at sea. The purpose of the Sino-Russian military exercise is to enhance exchanges and cooperation between the two countries in the military field in response to maritime emergencies through bilateral practical exercises. When there is an unexpected event, it can be dealt with more effectively and more specifically. More importantly, the Sino-Russian joint military exercise is within the framework of the SCO . This bilateral or other multilateral military exercise has a strong deterrent effect on the three forces in the region. Terrorist and separatist forces are increasingly common at sea crimes. Therefore, the "Southern Naval Act" cannot be considered as a quasi-alliance relationship. China and Russia are comprehensive strategic partnerships, including political, economic, and security cooperation. This military exercise is a concrete manifestation of cooperation in the security field and provides security for their respective economic construction.
China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership of cooperation represents a good period of cooperation between China and Russia. It has a high degree of strategic dialogue and strategic mutual trust in politics, and pragmatic cooperation in the economic field, and security is also an aspect of cooperation. Cooperation in the security field and economic and political cooperation are moving forward together and even starting earlier. All along, China and Russia have been actively promoting cooperation in the security and military fields. The cooperation between China and Russia in the military field has been increasingly concerned by the outside world due to the tension between Russia and Ukraine and the fact that the West is completely damaging Russia. Under this circumstance, the focus of Russia's foreign policy has naturally been adjusted, turning to the East and looking for new strategic priorities. In this process, Sino-Russian cooperation is closer and more specific, expanding from a small scope to a larger and deeper field, and from the land to the sea, this is a natural and gradual process.
This strategic cooperative partnership between China and Russia has a non-aligned nature that is not directed at third parties. This relationship is in the fundamental interests of both countries and is conducive to regional and world stability and peace. This bilateral relationship has a positive impact on building a new type of relationship between big powers and the international order. Or this non-aligned bilateral relationship is a model of modern state relations.

China-Serbia relations have been co-operating in China-Central and Eastern Europe and the construction of the "Belt and Road" The important positioning and development direction are also clearer, fully demonstrating the solid foundation and great prospects of the "friends and partners" relationship between China and Cyprus.
In their respective development processes, China-Serbia relations have always maintained the depth of mutual understanding and progress with the times, transcending time and space and geographical barriers, and transcending the differences in historical background, social system, ideology and development model. The common experience of the anti-fascist war has formed a common goal of the current Sino-Serbian cooperation to safeguard the post-war international order and defend world peace. The respect, exploration and mutual learning of their respective development paths have also become a model for the "harmony and difference" of the gentleman. . "All-weather friends" is both a historical and realistic portrayal of China-Serbia relations and a firm confidence and deep hope for the future development of China-Serbia relations.
Today, with the changing international and regional situation, China and Cyprus are pursuing an independent foreign policy and actively fostering and promoting political consensus. They are both old friends and new partners. After experiencing war and dramatic changes in the regional situation, Serbia is exploring a development path that is in line with its own national conditions and regional situation. It not only has the actual concern of safeguarding national unity, but also participates in regional integration and devotes itself to globalization to win more opportunities for cooperation. Long-term goal. The similar historical experience of hegemony and bullying has enabled China and Serbia to actively pursue the democratization of international relations and the international order of fairness and justice. The similarities between China and Cyprus in many development concerns have also determined that both sides have a major need to respect each other's interests and concerns, and can support and support each other on issues involving national sovereignty and regional situation.
Following becoming China's first strategic partner in Central and Eastern Europe in 2009, Serbia has become China's first comprehensive strategic partner in the region. This means that the political relations between the two sides have entered a period of maturity and stability, and will usher in a period of vigorous development in the field of economic and trade cooperation. It also shows that China and Serbia will work together to make new contributions to the development of the country and the region and the stability of the international situation.
On the realization of the common development goal, China-Serbia relations also have a strategic height of mutual support and mutual aid. Serbia is not only becoming an important model for cooperation between China and Central and Eastern European countries, but also becoming an important partner for the "One Belt, One Road" joint construction. As an important country in the Balkans and Central and Eastern Europe, Serbia seeks to cooperate with China in a positive and flexible manner. The two sides have made breakthroughs in pragmatic cooperation in large projects such as infrastructure, energy and capacity cooperation. The achievements in the "16+1" cooperation are the most outstanding. They not only achieved good economic and social benefits, but also directly benefited the people of the two countries. They also promoted the interconnection and communication between Central and Eastern Europe and produced positive demonstration effects.
Serbia is located in an important geographical channel between Central and Eastern Europe and Southeast Europe. It is an important hub for China-Central and Eastern European countries to cooperate with other parts of Europe to promote the "Belt and Road" in Europe. Therefore, Serbia has become a key node for the deep connection between the "16+1" cooperation and the "Belt and Road" construction. It can play a unique and important role in the existing Hungarian Railway, the China-Europe Express and the "Three Seaports" cooperation and other Unicom docking projects. The achievements of China-Serbia cooperation are not only an important part of the "One Belt, One Road" joint construction, but also provide valuable experience for China to cooperate with other countries.
On the basis of solid history and driven by the huge demand for mutual cooperation, China-Serbia relations have entered a new stage of "political friends + economic partners" and will continue to advance on this new journey.

Today, Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region have formed an interdependent relationship. The two regions have crossed the Pacific Ocean and the will to work together is stronger and firmer. The Chinese dream and the Latin American dream go hand in hand, and the two regions can achieve more economic vitality, more free trade, more convenient investment, and a more peaceful and rich life for the people.

Brazil, Colombia, Peru, and Chile are the most developed countries in Latin America, but they also face the historical task of upgrading infrastructure. The first ministerial meeting of the China-Latin America Forum listed infrastructure cooperation as one of the key areas for future cooperation between the two sides. The first China-Latin America Infrastructure Cooperation Forum, scheduled to be held in June this year, will also serve as a platform for communication and cooperation between China and Latin America to help the two sides cooperate in the field of infrastructure. Premier Li Keqiang's visit is a specific diplomatic activity to implement these cooperation ideas.
Third, jointly promote the development of the international political and economic order in a more just and rational direction. During his visit to Chile, Premier Li Keqiang will deliver an important speech to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean on China's views on this issue. The construction of the free trade zone shoulders the mission of China-Latin America cooperation to promote the international order toward more and more emerging countries and developing countries. China and Chile have established a free trade zone. China and Colombia have established a free trade zone feasibility study working group. In the future, China is expected to sign a free trade agreement with Pacific Union countries such as Chile, Peru, Colombia and Mexico. When President Xi Jinping visited Brazil last year, China, Brazil and Peru issued a joint statement on the cooperation between the two sides of the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. In his visit, Premier Li Keqiang will sign a cooperation document on the feasibility study of this transnational and trans-ocean railway, and make arrangements for launching the feasibility study. It is possible for the Colombian side to once again hope that China will help Colombia build a railway line connecting the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. Chile hopes that China will actively consider participating in the construction of the "Two Ocean Tunnel" that spans Chile and Argentina and connects the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean.
Deepening the cooperation between China and Latin America in the above-mentioned fields requires the three pillars of politics, economy and humanity as solid support. Enhance political mutual trust between China and Latin America, deepen mutually beneficial cooperation between the two sides, promote cultural exchanges and mutual understanding of civilizations, and become the theme of Premier Li Keqiang's visit to Latin America. By then, China will sign a series of cooperation documents with the four countries in the fields of culture, education and science and technology. Premier Li Keqiang will attend the China-Latin Arab Cultural Exchange Seminar in Colombia with President Santos, attend the activities of mutual understanding between China and Latin America in Peru, participate in the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Chile, and the 10th anniversary of the signing of the FTA, Chile's "Chinese Culture Year" "Other activities will further consolidate the new situation of the "five in one" development of China-Latin America relations.
Last year, President Xi Jinping visited Latin America and opened a new "China-Latin America time", which pointed out the direction for China and Latin America to deepen pragmatic cooperation and achieve common development. Now, Premier Li Keqiang's visit to the four Latin American countries is to enhance the level of pragmatic cooperation in various fields between China and Latin America. It is believed that the new "China-Latin America Cooperation" will surely bear fruit and achievements, promote regional development, benefit the people of China and Latin America, and at the same time help the world's peace and development.

On May 6, 1975, 40 years ago, China and the European Economic Community officially established diplomatic relations. This is a far-sighted decision on both sides. At that time, the world began to show a multi-polar development trend, and China and Europe hope to jointly lead this change.
40 years of vicissitudes. China's reform and opening up has made great achievements, and the European Community has evolved into the European Union . China and the EU support each other on their own development paths. They will help each other in the global challenges such as the 2008 international financial crisis. They will develop mutually beneficial cooperation in various fields such as economy and trade, for China's development and European integration, and for promoting world peace and development. Actively contribute.
Confucius said that forty is not confusing. On the occasion of the 40th anniversary of China-EU relations, the two sides are working together to build the four partnerships of peace, growth, reform and civilization. According to the China-EU Cooperation 2020 Strategic Plan, we are looking for effective issues for the most important issues concerning world peace and security. Solution.
We have personally participated in the recent negotiations on the Iranian nuclear issue and pushed the parties to reach an initial agreement on the "core elements" of the Comprehensive Joint Action Plan. This is conducive to maintaining regional peace, and it also sets an important precedent for promoting nuclear non-proliferation in other regions. Both China and the EU believe that without the efforts of all parties, it is impossible to achieve positive results. China and the EU are closely coordinating and pushing for a comprehensive agreement on the Iranian nuclear issue.
With the joint efforts of China and the EU and with all parties in the world, we have effectively curbed piracy and safeguarded the safety of navigation in Somalia and the Gulf of Aden. Last year, the Chinese Navy and the EU "Atalanta" naval formation successfully held two joint anti-piracy exercises in the Horn of Africa. The two sides will continue this cooperation and will actively explore ways to eliminate the root causes of piracy. We also plan to expand our focus on promoting peace and security in Africa , including supporting African Union capacity building and cooperation in places like Mali.
These achievements encourage China and the EU to strengthen collaboration, because China and the EU can join hands to cope with more long-standing peace and security challenges. For example, in the Middle East peace process, we are all committed to promoting a comprehensive "two-state plan." We also believe that the Ukrainian crisis can only be resolved through political means and on the basis of full respect for international law, including respect for Ukraine's sovereignty, territorial integrity and national independence. We call on all parties concerned to take responsibility and fully implement the commitments they made in the Minsk Agreement.
During the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping to the European Union last year, China and the EU pledged to jointly explore the convergence of the China Silk Road Economic Belt Initiative and EU policy. Both China and the EU are important members of the Eurasian continent. The two sides will work together with countries along the Silk Road to strengthen communication and docking.
Opposing all forms of terrorism is also the common responsibility of China and the EU. The EU is grateful to the Chinese government for its efforts to safely evacuate citizens from China, the EU and other countries from Yemen. The two sides will continue their efforts to resolve the serious crisis in Syria, Libya and Yemen through political consultation under the UN framework, and will do everything in their power to avoid the recurrence of such crises in the future.
In 1975, China-EU relations started from economic and trade cooperation. After 40 years of development, the mutual dependence of the two sides has reached an unprecedented level. According to Chinese statistics, the annual trade volume of Central Europe has exceeded 600 billion US dollars, with an average of 16,000 passengers per day and more than 70 flights between China and EU countries. The two sides are determined to further strengthen economic and trade exchanges, promote the facilitation of personnel exchanges, enhance two-way investment and improve market access on a reciprocal basis.
For decades, both China and the EU have recognized the need to follow a path of sustainable and inclusive development. Structural reform and innovation are at the core. China and the EU should strengthen constructive interaction, support each other, and work together to achieve sustainable development goals. This is also the foundation of China-EU comprehensive strategic partnership.
China and the EU are responsible for the well-being of a quarter of the world's population. The two major economies of China and Europe have a huge impact on the world. Both sides should strengthen coordination at the multilateral level. We are vigorously advancing the negotiations on climate change to ensure that the Paris Climate Change Conference can achieve ambitious results. The forthcoming China-EU summit will also discuss this issue and work to propose a common proposal from China and the EU.
UN post-2015 development agenda to eradicate poverty, promote growth long and important opportunity and the means to achieve human rights, particularly the right to development. China and the EU will work together to develop a fair, inclusive and sustainable post-2015 development agenda.
This year marks the end of World War II and the 70th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations . Central Europe is the same as " Lian HeguoXianzhang" based international order after World War II defenders and builders. The two sides will continue to support the " United Nations objectives, principles and universal Charter", actively maintain security, development and human rights, committed to advancing the democratization of international relations and the international rule of law in governance, promote the international order more just and equitable development .

Bell: South-South cooperation brings historic changes

The improvement of the level of South-South cooperation means a historic change, and the world economy will gain new impetus, and the international order will become more fair and reasonable.
During President Xi Jinping's visit to Latin America, the China-Crazy Community Forum was proclaimed, releasing a strong signal that China and Latin American countries have joined hands and promoted South-South cooperation.
South-South cooperation refers to cooperation between developing countries. Since the middle of the last century, similar historical encounters and common development aspirations have united the vast number of developing countries under the framework of South-South cooperation. Countries have made unremitting efforts to get rid of excessive dependence on developed countries and achieve unity and self-improvement.
However, due to the poor economic background of most developing countries and the immature domestic demand market, many developing countries adopting export-oriented policies are still the main destination markets. The economic take-off of some countries and regions after the Second World War was largely driven by exports to developed countries.
This situation is now quietly changing. Developing countries and emerging market countries have driven each other's development momentum and have become one of the most prominent changes in the current global economy. After experiencing the two stages of technical cooperation and economic cooperation among developing countries, South-South cooperation has gradually moved toward a multi-faceted and multi-disciplinary period of cooperation, which has been achieved in various developing countries, regions and even the world. Important progress.
A report released by the Brookings Institution in the first half of this year confirms the above changes. In 2000, more than 80% of the goods shipped from China to the world were developed economies, and the current proportion has fallen to 68%. In 2000, products that accounted for 55% of Brazil's total exports were sold to developed economies, and by the end of 2011, the proportion had fallen to around 40%. In India, trade with the United States and Europe accounted for 47% of total trade at the beginning of this century, and now it has fallen to 29%.
During his visit to Brazil, President Xi Jinping pointed out that China and Pakistan are mutually important partners and bilateral relations are developing continuously, which is a model for South-South cooperation. An important basis of this paradigm is the significant complementarity of the economies of both sides. China has become Brazil's largest trading partner for five consecutive years. Brazil has long been China's largest trading partner and important investment destination in Latin America. The pragmatic cooperation between the two countries not only covers the traditional economic and trade fields, but also extends to resource satellites, regional aircraft, and deep-sea oil exploration. High-tech fields such as development and biotechnology can be said to be in the air and inclusive.
China is the largest developing country in the world. In the course of development, China has consistently combined its own interests with the common interests of the vast number of developing countries and played an irreplaceable role in promoting the level of South-South cooperation. China-SAC Forum, BRICS Development Bank, BRICS contingency reserve arrangements, and exploration of the construction of the two-ocean railway connecting the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean... A series of cooperation projects reached during President Xi's visit to Latin America indicated that in South-South China's role is particularly prominent in the process of improving communication channels and mechanisms and extending to the investment and financial sectors.
The economic strength of the vast number of developing countries, their economic and trade ties, and the mutual trust established through years of increased exchanges have been completely different from the last century. Looking into the future, the improvement of the level of South-South cooperation will enable more developing countries and emerging market countries to play an increasingly important role on the international stage. In the course of this historic transformation, the world economy will gain new impetus and the international order will become more just and reasonable.

On July 20, local time, President Xi Jinping held talks with Venezuelan President Maduro in Caracas. Xinhua News Agency reporter Lan Hongguang photo
Newspaper, Caracas, July 20 (Reporter Du Shangze, Ding Gang) On July 20, local time, President Xi Jinping held talks with Venezuelan President Maduro in Caracas. In a frank and friendly atmosphere, the two heads of state exchanged in-depth views on China-Venezuela relations and other issues of common concern, reached broad consensus, and unanimously decided to upgrade China-Venezuela relations to a comprehensive strategic partnership and strengthen bilateral cooperation in a broader field.
Maduro warmly welcomed Xi Jinping's state visit to Venezuela and expressed his hope that the visit will deepen and expand bilateral cooperation and raise the level of relations between the two countries.
Xi Jinping pointed out that the Central Committee is a good friend who trusts each other and a good partner for mutual benefit and win-win. We cherish the important contribution of former Venezuelan President Chavez to the development of China-Venezuela relations and appreciate President Maduro's succession to Chavez's friendly policy toward China. On the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries, the relationship between China and Venezuela is at an important stage in the past and the future. We unanimously agreed to upgrade the relationship between the two countries into a comprehensive strategic partnership with the core of strategic mutual trust, comprehensive cooperation, mutual benefit and common development. Xi Jinping made four suggestions.
First, grasp the overall situation. The two countries will maintain regular contact with each other. The two governments, political parties, and legislatures will strengthen exchanges, strengthen strategic planning, deepen political mutual trust, and continue to support each other on issues involving core interests.
Second, focus on effectiveness. To strengthen the top-level design of cooperation between the two countries, we must be determined to forge ahead and be brave in development. We must be pragmatic and efficient, step by step, adhere to mutual benefit and reciprocity, deepen the integration of interests, use finance and investment as the engine, and focus on energy cooperation. The two sides should use the financing cooperation mechanism to promote minerals, infrastructure construction, and scientific and technological cooperation, and start the construction of agricultural demonstration parks as soon as possible. China is willing to increase the transfer of satellite technology to the party and encourage strong Chinese enterprises to actively participate in the construction of the Venezuela special economic zone.
Third, expand exchanges. It is necessary to take the opportunity of the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries to promote cooperation in culture, education, tourism and media, and to consolidate the foundation of the friendly and public opinion of the Central Committee.
Fourth, focus on the overall situation. Put China-Venezuela relations in the overall situation of China-Latin America relations, solidarity and cooperation among developing countries, and overall planning for world peace and development. I appreciate President Maduro's attendance at the BRICS and South American leaders' dialogue meeting and the China-Latin America leaders' meeting and make important suggestions. China is willing to work with the party to build a China-Latin America forum and promote the overall cooperation between China and Latin America. The two sides will also strengthen coordination and cooperation on international affairs such as global economic governance, energy security, and climate change, and more to convey the voice of developing countries to the international community and promote the development of the international order in a more just and rational direction.
Maduro said that the Central Committee has strong political mutual trust and the two countries have identical views on many major issues. We appreciate China's long history and culture, admire the great achievements of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and believe that China will play a greater role in promoting world peace and development. We will firmly inherit the wishes of Chavez and strengthen all-round cooperation with China from a strategic perspective. I fully appreciate the proposal put forward by President Xi Jinping and hope to maintain close ties with President Xi Jinping and promote cooperation between the two countries. The party welcomes Chinese companies to expand their investment in Venezuela and participate in projects such as petrochemical industry and special economic zone development. President Xi Jinping's important ideas and measures put forward in strengthening the overall cooperation between the two countries at the China-Latin America summit meeting a few miles ago will be a milestone and will promote the common development of the two countries. The party firmly supports the establishment of the China-Latin America Forum and is willing to make positive contributions to promoting the relations between China and Latin America.
Maduro introduced the domestic situation in Venezuela and said that Venezuela is committed to maintaining national stability, promoting economic development, strengthening the capacity building of the ruling party, and thanking China for its consistent support. Xi Jinping emphasized that China respects Venezuela's development path in line with its national conditions and supports the Venezuelan government's active efforts to maintain domestic stability. It is believed that the Venezuelan government and people can handle their internal affairs and maintain domestic harmony and stability and economic and social development. China is willing to learn from each other's experience in governing the country's governance and party building, and continue to carry out exchanges and cooperation in cadre training and other aspects.
The two sides also exchanged views on regional hot issues of common concern. When talking about the current situation in Palestine and Israel, Xi Jinping pointed out that the recent development of the situation in Palestine and Israel is worrying. We are saddened and gravely concerned by the massive civilian casualties caused by the conflict in Gaza. The Chinese side expressed their position on the request of an immediate ceasefire. We support the mediation efforts of the United Nations and regional and Arab Leagues . China has always supported the just cause of the Palestinian people. Peace talks are the only correct way to achieve peace between Palestine and Israel. All parties concerned should overcome difficulties and move in the same direction, and strive for an early resumption of talks. China will continue to make efforts to ease the situation in Palestine and Israel and maintain regional peace and stability.
After the talks, the two heads of state jointly met with reporters. Xi Jinping pointed out that I have reviewed with President Maduro the 40-year development of China-Venezuela relations and outlined the grand blueprint for the development of bilateral relations. The establishment of a comprehensive strategic partnership is a common choice of both sides and is in the fundamental interests of the two countries and their peoples. The two sides will use this as an opportunity to make further progress and make the mutually beneficial and friendly cooperation between the two countries continue to release new vitality and vitality.
Maduro said that I had a comprehensive and in-depth friendly talk with President Xi Jinping, and reached an important consensus on developing cooperation between the two countries and promoting cooperation between the two countries. Venezuela will continue to develop a comprehensive strategic partnership with China along the path opened by the former President Chavez.
Wang Huning, Li Zhanshu, Yang Jiechi, etc. participated in the above activities.

On February 20th, US Vice President Penns visited Brussels. This is the first US senior official to visit the EU headquarters after the Trump administration took office. Burns and the EU's top leaders met in succession, pledge that the Trump administration will continue to support the EU, develop trade and security cooperation between the United States and Europe, and try to send the EU a "reassuring". In Brussels, Burns held talks with President of the European Council Tusk, European Commission President Juncker, NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg, and EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Mogherini. He tried to show the EU that despite President Trump's remarks criticizing the EU, the United States still hopes to work hard with the EU. In his meeting, Mr. Burns said: "I was commissioned by President Trump to declare that the United States has an obligation to cooperate and cooperate with the EU." He stressed that the new US government promises to continue to develop cooperation with the EU. Partnerships. Burns added: "Despite the differences between us, the two continents in Europe and the United States enjoy a common heritage and common values." On the Ukrainian issue, Burns said that the United States will continue to demand Russia to abide by the Minsk agreement for the situation in eastern Ukraine. Cool down. Burns called on both parties to abide by the ceasefire agreement and said that the United States will "explore a new way to reach a new consensus with Russia." After meeting with Burns, Tusk said that during the talks, he proposed three key issues to Pengs on the international order, European security and the US support for EU solidarity. Pengs gave positive and positive responses. After Trump took office, he sent a lot of unfriendly signals to the EU. He ridiculed that "NATO is outdated" and accused NATO members of failing to fulfill their responsibility of using 2% of GDP for defense spending. They also criticized "the EU is a tool for Germany" and praised Britain's "Brexit" as "a great historical event." "It is predicted that other countries will "follow the next". In addition, Trump's trade protectionist policy has brought many uncertainties to the US-Europe economic and trade relations. After Trump took office, a series of words and deeds made the relationship between Europe and the United States fall into a "low valley". European mainstream public opinion has questioned Trump's policy toward Europe. The analysis here believes that in order to ease the tension between the two sides and enhance strategic mutual trust, Burns recently opened his first European trip after taking office, constantly appeasing the European allies and reaffirming the common position between the United States and Europe. Although the EU has affirmed the words and deeds of Burns, it still has a wait-and-see attitude toward whether the Trump administration can "do the same." (The newspaper, Brussels, February 21st)

People's Daily Online, Beijing, August 18th, Wu Jian, spokesman of the Ministry of National Defense, made a speech on the 17th "Report on China's Military and Security Development Situation" on the 17th. The full text is as follows:
The US Department of Defense issued the 2018 "China Military and Security Development Situation Report", misinterpreting China's strategic intentions, rendering the so-called "China military threat", and discussing cross-strait relations and the Taiwan Strait situation. The Chinese military has expressed firm opposition to this and has made solemn representations to the US.
China firmly adheres to the path of peaceful development and firmly pursues a defensive national defense policy. It has always been a builder of world peace, a contributor to global development, and a defender of the international order. In recent years, the Chinese military has increasingly carried out overseas military tasks such as peacekeeping, escort, and disaster relief, and has taken on more international responsibilities and provided more public safety products within its capabilities. The contributions and efforts made by the international community have been widely appreciated.
The Chinese military has strengthened its modernization drive in order to safeguard the country's sovereignty, security, and development interests and safeguard world peace, stability, and prosperity. The reform of the Chinese military, the development of weapons and equipment, and the construction of cyberspace defense capabilities are justified. The accusations in the US report are pure speculation.
Taiwan is a part of China. This is an iron fact. We demand that the US adhere to the one-China principle and the three Sino-US joint communiques and carefully handle the Taiwan-related issues. The Chinese military will, as always, firmly defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity and firmly safeguard peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.
China's position on the maritime issue is consistent and clear. China is committed to peacefully resolving disputes through direct negotiations and negotiations with relevant countries. China's peaceful construction activities in the South Island Reef are the legitimate rights of sovereign states. In addition to meeting the necessary national defense needs, they serve civil needs to better fulfill their international responsibilities and obligations. The United States is playing the banner of "freedom of navigation" and frequently dispatching warplanes to the South China Sea to provoke tensions and create tensions. This is the real threat to regional peace and stability.
The United States has published the so-called "China Military and Security Development Situation Report" year after year, which has damaged Sino-US mutual trust and is inconsistent with the common interests of both sides. We demand that the US side abandon the Cold War mentality, objectively and rationally view China's national defense and army building, stop publishing relevant reports, and take practical actions to maintain the stable development of the relations between the two militaries.

Recently, the US attitude toward the Iranian nuclear agreement has drawn attention from all sides. Although Trump, the US president, did not withdraw from the agreement as many people feared, his tough stance is still worrying. Behind the turmoil surrounding this multilateral agreement is actually the adjustment of the US Middle East policy.
The Middle East is very "hot"
Recently, the United States has frequently acted on issues involving the Middle East.
In the past weekend, Trump refused to sign a presidential confirmation of the implementation of the Iranian nuclear agreement. According to the BBC website, under the strong opposition, he did not directly "kill" the agreement, but kicked the "ball" to Congress. In the next 60 days, the US Congress will decide the fate of the agreement.
Trump's dissatisfaction is well known for the Iranian nuclear deal. He has repeatedly stated his position to withdraw from the agreement. According to the U.S.nuclear agreement review bill passed by the U.S. Congress , the President will inform the Congress of Iran's compliance with the agreement every 90 days. This time, Trump acknowledged Iran's compliance with the agreement, but stressed that the United States will continue to use sanctions to pressure Iran. This is the third time he has made this statement to Congress since he took office in January this year. It is also considered to be the one that the US is most likely to identify Iran's "default" and then prompt Congress to proceed to the Iranian nuclear agreement.
On October 12, the US State Department issued a statement saying that the United States will withdraw from UNESCO , and Israel has also announced that it will follow the United States to withdraw from the organization. One of the reasons for this move in the United States is still from the Middle East. As early as 2011, UNESCO approved Palestine as a full member state, which was equivalent to disguising the national identity of Palestine in disguise, sparking strong opposition from the United States and immediately suspending payment of membership dues. In May of this year, UNESCO called Israel "the occupying Power" in a resolution. In July, the old town of Hebron in Palestine declared its success in World Heritage, and it was under Israeli control. All of the above have caused strong dissatisfaction with the United States.
In addition, on October 6, during the visit of Saudi King Salman to Russia, the United States announced the sale of the "Sade" anti-missile system to Saudi Arabia. In May of this year, although Trump reached a $110 billion arms sales agreement with Saudi Arabia during the visit, neither the United States nor Saudi Arabia announced the details of this unprecedented big order.
What does the US want?
Since Trump entered the White House, friction between the United States and Iran has continued. However, Trump did not withdraw from the Iranian nuclear agreement whenever he had the opportunity. Why is Trump choosing to raise the door at this time?
"President Trump has realigned the ranking of risk factors in the Middle East. Today, Iran has replaced the so-called 'Islamic State' as the 'number one enemy' of the United States." The BBC website reported that experts cited the analysis.
Some analysts pointed out that Trump's Middle East policy after he took office was to limit Iran in an all-round way. During his visit to Saudi Arabia, he explicitly asked the Middle East allies to jointly target Iran. Trump has continuously raised the threat of withdrawing from the agreement, intending to pressure Iran and the international community to seek renegotiation to achieve the goal of comprehensively curbing Iran.
Moreover, the subtle changes in the situation in the Middle East have also recently caused unease in the United States.
From October 4th to 7th, Saudi King Salman visited Russia and became the first Saudi king to visit Russia. According to Russian media reports, the two countries reached at least $3 billion in arms purchase agreements, of which the S-400 anti-aircraft missile orders are particularly eye-catching. In fact, in recent months, Egypt, Jordan, Israel, Turkey and other countries have visited.
Some experts pointed out that this "pro-Russian wave" actually reflects whether Obama's "light footprint strategy" or Trump's "limited intervention policy" can no longer play the role of the Middle East order defender expected by American allies. On the contrary, Russia has returned to the Middle East with great strength, and with the help of military intervention in Syria, it has established the status of an important player in the East.
This time, Trump wants to suppress Iran's proximity to these traditional allies and enhance the influence of the United States in the Middle East. Due to the close interaction between Iran and Russia, increasing the "knocking" of Iran can also curb Russia's influence in the Middle East.
Many outsiders question
Although Trump did not withdraw from the Iranian nuclear agreement, according to the Associated Press, Trump said at the White House: "As president, I can let the United States withdraw from the agreement at any time."
Trump's tough attitude has raised concerns. The UN Secretary-General, British Prime Minister Teresa May, German Chancellor Merkel and French President Mark Long have all expressed their support for the Iranian nuclear agreement.
As the AFP commentary pointed out, "US priority" does not mean "the United States is alone". In the case that other parties support the Iranian nuclear agreement, "the United States has clearly become isolated and helpless". In addition, Europe, which is adjacent to the Middle East, fears that once the agreement is destroyed, Iran may resume its nuclear program, exacerbating regional tensions and endangering its own security. At the same time, the United States has also given up its "leading role in a stable, rule-based global landscape."
Some experts pointed out that once the United States withdraws from the Iranian nuclear agreement, the international community will question the continuity and stability of US foreign policy, and then question the legitimacy of the global leadership position emphasized by the United States. At the same time, the stability and benign development of the global order will also suffer extremes. Big shock.
In addition, there are many questions about Trump's Middle East policy in the United States. CNN quoted experts as saying that the Trump administration's many policies are said to be much less done. Today, its so-called "strategy" against Iran is also worrying.
As the analysis pointed out, since Trump took office, he has made a new round of adjustments to the US Middle East policy. The United States has launched another round of arms race in the Middle East through a huge arms sales to Saudi Arabia. The tension between the two camps in Saudi Arabia and Iran has further escalated. In the future, the United States and Iran will play a large-scale drama in the Middle East, and the Middle East will continue to be a hot spot on the international stage.

China National People's Congress News

People's Daily Online, Beijing, March 4th, the fifth session of the 12th National People's Congress held a press conference in the press room of the Great Hall of the People. Fu Ying, a spokesman for the conference, answered questions from Chinese and foreign journalists on the agenda of the conference and issues related to the work of the National People's Congress. .
In response to "What will China's military expenditures be in 2017?" Fu Ying said that according to the accurate data provided by the Ministry of Finance, the growth rate of China's national defense expenditure in 2017 is about 7%, accounting for about 1.3% of GDP.
The following is a record of the conference:
Reporter: I am CNN of US cable TV news, then let me ask the required answer. You also know that China's military strength has grown in recent years, including the construction of aircraft carriers, the construction of islands and reefs in the South China Sea islands, military deployment, and the updating of weapons and equipment, all of which are of concern to countries around the world, including the United States. Since the territorial disputes between China and some neighboring countries have not yet been resolved, the growth of these military forces has also left many countries with caution and certain vigilance. My question is: What will China's military expenditures this year be, and how will it increase? If the economic growth rate slows down, what is the consideration for the larger increase in military spending? Is it related to the recent increase in US military spending announced by President Trump?
Fu Ying: Every year, the Chinese government determines the scale of our national defense expenditure according to the needs of national defense construction and the level of our national economic development. In 2017, the growth rate of China's national defense expenditure was about 7%. Our defense expenditure accounts for about 1.3% of GDP. These years have been at this level, which is accurate data provided by the Ministry of Finance. You just mentioned that the United States advocates raising funds. The US military spending is already very big. I went to Munich to attend a security conference. NATO is also emphasizing that the proportion of defense fees for each of them should be raised to 2%. I don't know how you guys. Assess this trend and ask them what they are considering.
When you talk about wariness against China, I think many people in China are definitely not understanding. Looking at the past ten years or so, there have been so many conflicts and even wars in the world, causing a serious number of casualties and property losses. So many refugees have been displaced. Which one is caused by China? China has never brought any harm to any country. We are concerned about the disputes over these territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests that exist around China. We advocate dialogue and peaceful resolution, and we must have the ability to defend our sovereignty and rights. In particular, you also noticed that we really want to prevent external forces from intervening in disputes. The enhancement of China's capabilities is conducive to maintaining peace and security in the region, not the other way around. Now on this controversial issue, the recent trend is very obvious. Some countries in China and ASEAN have returned to the track of dialogue and discussion. The situation in the South China Sea has also eased. How to develop the future depends on the intention of the United States and the activities of the United States in the South China Sea. Has a certain wind vane meaning.
On the South China Sea issue, it is misleading to say that the South China Sea is safe to sail. I visited the UK in July last year and talked a lot about this issue. A legal expert from our peers specifically checked that the information of the City of London in the UK shows that the South China Sea is not listed as a high-risk area, and there is no data showing which international The insurance company of Shangda has increased the insurance premiums for ships and merchant ships passing through the South China Sea. Where does the worry about navigation safety in the South China Sea come from?
We also learned during the visit last year that Reuters survey shows that some shipping companies believe that China's presence in this region is actually beneficial to security. So I think, fundamentally, I don't know if you agree to disagree. The United States is still worried that China will catch up with or surpass the United States. In fact, as a developing country, China has a large gap in capacity with the United States, but China's military development and construction is going to continue. This is our need to defend national sovereignty and security.
Whether the military and the military pose a threat, whether it is necessary to be wary, the key depends on their strategic intentions. This is a key issue to be seriously explored. In other words, is it to pursue common security or exclusive security. The concept of China proposed by President Xi Jinping is to maintain common security, which is also a consensus of many Asian countries.

Can the US "Asia-Pacific rebalancing" strategy continue?

On November 21st, US President-elect Trump officially announced that the United States will not join the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP). This decision is destined to represent the largest regional trade and investment agreement in history, but whether it directly affects the continued advancement of the US "Asia-Pacific rebalancing" strategy. At present, this issue has triggered widespread public opinion around the world.
As we all know, TPP is an important economic pillar of the US "Asia-Pacific rebalancing" strategy. Regardless of the consideration of the Trump administration, the withdrawal of the United States from the TPP will inevitably cause the United States to lose its economic dominance in the Asia-Pacific region, thereby reducing regional political leadership. At the same time, the US's move also lost its original commitment and guarantee to Asian allies, and to a certain extent, the United States' reputation among Asian allies was greatly reduced. In addition, this move also marked the largest strategic retreat after the Second World War.
From a comprehensive perspective, compared with the Obama administration, although the Trump administration has different ruling ideas and different political views, is it so unconventional and has a national strategy to withdraw from the TPP, is it really necessary to completely terminate the "Asia-Pacific rebalancing"? Strategy? The author believes that the answer is no.
On the one hand, the United States will not easily withdraw from the Asia-Pacific.
With the development of the world situation and economic trade, the Asia-Pacific region, which has more than a quarter of the world's population, has become a global focus, both economically and strategically. In recent years, the Obama administration of the United States has vigorously promoted the policy of the Asia-Pacific region, actively implemented the "Asia-Pacific rebalancing" strategy, and deliberately strengthened the military deployment of the Asia-Pacific region, which has made the Asia-Pacific region an important region of the US global strategy. In particular, the United States has huge trade and investment in Asia, which cannot be changed or disappeared. Therefore, there is no doubt that the withdrawal of the United States from the TPP does not mean that the United States does not accept the "Asia-Pacific rebalancing" strategy. The Trump administration will inevitably adopt other more active or more radical bilateral trade agreements instead, and strengthen it through various means and channels. The objective existence of the United States in the Asia-Pacific region, maintaining close contact and contacts with Asia, and efforts to offset the possible impact of this factor.
On the other hand, the United States will not give up regional influence and power.
The Asia Pacific region has an extremely important strategic value to the United States. In recent years, the United States has been actively expanding the construction of military bases in this region, trying to build a strategic hub for regional joint military presence. At present, nearly half of the total number of US overseas military bases is in the Asia-Pacific region, and has been built into larger-scale regional clusters. These base facilities are both an important part of the US military deployment and an important part of maintaining the dominance and influence of the Asia-Pacific region. pillar. In Trump's view, the US withdrawal from the TPP is only an initiative in the economic field. Although it will have a negative impact on its prestige and also cause damage to allies in the Asia-Pacific region, it will not retreat in military strategy. The Trump administration will adopt a new strategy of "strengthening peace with strength" to assure Asian allies that the United States will not only remain in Asia, but will also focus on strengthening military spending and military deployment in the Asia-Pacific region to continue to maintain the United States. The dominant control and military advantage of this region.
National interests above all else have always been the core goals advocated and respected by successive US governments, including the newly elected Trump. Although Trump has not shown much interest in the Asia-Pacific region and even is skeptical about Asian trade, it will never turn a blind eye to China's rise and development, especially the impact of the US withdrawal from the TPP to China. Although the Trump administration has not yet begun to implement the New Deal, it is a tough representative of the external security policy and the "hawks" from its recent appointments to new core positions such as the Central Intelligence Director, the Attorney General, and the National Security Adviser. "People, it is not difficult to see the national security and military strategy that emerged."
For a long time, the US government has regarded China as a direct or potential adversary to guard against it, and has insisted on leading the post-World War II international order as a traditional foreign policy thinking. In the next step, how the Trump administration's global strategy is laid out and what kind of policy policies will be adopted in other fields has already attracted the attention and rational thinking of the international community.

Expert: China and Russia demonstrate determination to maintain world stability

The outside world has always been highly concerned about the Sino-Russian joint military exercise, especially the United States and Japan. However, the words "quasi-confederation" are used to describe Sino-Russian relations precisely because they have not jumped out of their "alliance circle." Because the United States and Japan are alliances, the United States has always used this relationship to look at the relations between other countries. The Sino-Russian military exercise is a routine military exercise, which is normal in any area. It is only because of the recent South China Sea issue that many Western countries, especially the United States and Japan, naturally associate two things together. This is "the belly of a gentleman with a heart of a villain." From their own perspective, they look at this Sino-Russian military exercise with their cold war mentality.
Nowadays, international relations are complicated, especially in the context of the fact that the South China Sea issue is constantly being confused by the strategic intention of the United States. The Sino-Russian joint military exercise actually shows the world the determination of the two countries to jointly safeguard peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region. It is reasonable and legal to conduct military exercises on possible conflicts and accidents at sea. The purpose of the Sino-Russian military exercise is to enhance exchanges and cooperation between the two countries in the military field in response to maritime emergencies through bilateral practical exercises. When there is an unexpected event, it can be dealt with more effectively and more specifically. More importantly, the Sino-Russian joint military exercise is within the framework of the SCO . This bilateral or other multilateral military exercise has a strong deterrent effect on the three forces in the region. Terrorist and separatist forces are increasingly common at sea crimes. Therefore, the "Southern Naval Act" cannot be considered as a quasi-alliance relationship. China and Russia are comprehensive strategic partnerships, including political, economic, and security cooperation. This military exercise is a concrete manifestation of cooperation in the security field and provides security for their respective economic construction.
China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership of cooperation represents a good period of cooperation between China and Russia. It has a high degree of strategic dialogue and strategic mutual trust in politics, and pragmatic cooperation in the economic field, and security is also an aspect of cooperation. Cooperation in the security field and economic and political cooperation are moving forward together and even starting earlier. All along, China and Russia have been actively promoting cooperation in the security and military fields. The cooperation between China and Russia in the military field has been increasingly concerned by the outside world due to the tension between Russia and Ukraine and the fact that the West is completely damaging Russia. Under this circumstance, the focus of Russia's foreign policy has naturally been adjusted, turning to the East and looking for new strategic priorities. In this process, Sino-Russian cooperation is closer and more specific, expanding from a small scope to a larger and deeper field, and from the land to the sea, this is a natural and gradual process.
This strategic cooperative partnership between China and Russia has a non-aligned nature that is not directed at third parties. This relationship is in the fundamental interests of both countries and is conducive to regional and world stability and peace. This bilateral relationship has a positive impact on building a new type of relationship between big powers and the international order. Or this non-aligned bilateral relationship is a model of modern state relations.

Expanding military power Russia and NATO "hard hit"

Russian Defense Minister Shoygu said on May 4 that the Russian Defense Ministry is taking a series of measures to build three new divisions by the end of this year to counter the increasing deployment of NATO's "closer to the Russian border." It is reported that the three divisions planned by Russia, including two divisions in the Western Military Region and one division in the Southern Military Region, are all around 10,000. The three divisions will adopt the most advanced modular construction scheme, including motorized infantry, tank soldiers, self-propelled rocket artillery, anti-aircraft artillery, reconnaissance, communications and other arms, equipped with advanced equipment such as T-90 tanks and BMP-3 infantry fighting vehicles. Currently, equipment installations are underway at the new force station. With regard to the escalating tension between Russia and NATO, Russia insists that NATO's eastward expansion and the deployment of anti-missile systems in Europe are the "culprits."
Recently, a series of frictions between Russia and NATO in the Baltic Sea have caused conflicts between the two sides to intensify. Last week, the United States accused the Russian warplanes of intercepting US reconnaissance planes in the Baltic sea; in early April, two Russian warplanes flew nearly a US missile destroyer in the Baltic Sea. In response, the Russian NATO special envoy Grusko explained that the destroyer approached the Russian territory of Kaliningrad and intended to "impress military pressure" against Russia.
NATO coaching has also added to the relationship between NATO and Russia. On May 3, the former US commander of the US military in South Korea, Scarparetti, became the Supreme Commander of the European Allies. On the same day, Scarparoti said that NATO members should be ready to fight against Russia at all times. US Defense Minister Carter also accused Russia of "showing off nuclear weapons" and deliberately undermined the international order, so the United States must now "focus on defense" in the east wing of NATO. Carter outlined plans to deploy a third US military brigade in Europe next year to allow the allies to see the United States' determination to help it resist the Russian threat. Carter said it is part of a $3.4 billion plan and could send up to four battalions or 4,000 soldiers to Eastern Europe. In addition, the former European Allied Commander-in-Chief Bridrav also said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal that the US funds for investigating Russian military forces are insufficient and more satellites should be called.
Russia's response to the US speech is fierce. Pushkar, chairman of the Russian State Duma Foreign Affairs Committee, said that Scarparoti's remarks show that he is more inclined to intensify contradictions than his predecessor, Bridrav. Russian government official newspaper "Russian newspaper" on the 5th stressed that on the eve of the 71st anniversary of the victory of World War II, NATO member states' military exercises are only 30 kilometers away from Russia. NATO's expansion is not a one-off event, intimidating or squeezing Russia "no benefit".
The new developments of the two sides have caused concern to the international community. Some media commentators even said that they "smelled the smell of the 'new cold war'." (Reporter of the newspaper in Russia)
