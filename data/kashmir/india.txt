India, Aug. 16 -- The government has decided to start rolling back the unprecedented clampdown on communication and restrictions on movement imposed in Jammu and Kashmir over the next few days, the state's top bureaucrat said on Friday. Phone lines in Srinagar will start getting restored from tonight, first in Srinagar and schools will start reopening from Monday, area by area.
The restrictions will be eased in a gradual calibrated manner, Chief Secretary BVR Subrahmanyam announced. He said the restrictions had been imposed due to credible inputs about efforts by terrorist groups based out of Pakistan to carry out attacks and create disturbances.
"Our primary responsibility was to ensure that there is no loss of life. There hasn't been a single loss of life or serious injuries to anyone despite efforts by Pakistan to destablise," the top bureaucrat in the state said, attributing this feat to cooperation extended by people and the steps taken by security forces.
Kashmir was shut for the 12th consecutive day on Friday even as authorities relaxed the restrictions in this summer capital of Jammu, allowing people to move around relatively freely for the first time since the Centre abrogated provisions of Article 370 and divided the state into two union territories.
The steps were announced at a Press conference by BVR Subrahmanyam hours after the Centre promised the Supreme Court to ease the restrictions but asked that the top court trust the security agencies to do their work.
There will be easing of restrictions over the next few days. Schools will be reopened after the weekend, public transport will be allowed gradually and all government offices were made fully functional from today. "The situation after Friday prayers was also very calm," he stated.
The official said 12 of the state's 22 districts are functioning normally and measures have been put in place to ensure zero loss of lives on any side or serious injuries to anyone.
Telecom connectivity will be eased and restored in a phase manner keeping in mind the constant threat by terror organizations, he said.

The PM lays out his blueprint

Mumbai, Aug. 16 -- Narendra Modi has made the habit of using the prime minister's Independence Day speech to present big ideas and emphasise his government's priorities. Between 2014 and 2018, in the five speeches he gave from the ramparts of the Red Fort, he launched three big missions - Swachh Bharat in 2014, Start-up India in 2015, and Ayushman Bharat in 2018.
He also lashed out at Pakistan for nurturing terrorists in 2016, and asked Kashmiris to join the mainstream in 2017. With the benefit of hindsight, the first statement heralded the resetting of the India-pakistan equilibrium. In September 2016, India responded to the Uri terror attack by carrying out surgical strikes across the Line of Control. And earlier this year, it responded to the Pulwama terror attack with an airstrike against a terror training facility inside Pakistan. The second statement (again, with the benefit of hindsight) was a reiteration of the Modi government's commitment to scrapping Articles 370 and 35A of the Constitution that gave Jammu and Kashmir special status, and its permanent residents, special privileges.
Given this background, it is worthwhile to trawl the PM'S latest speech - the first in his second term, and one that comes at the end of a productive session of Parliament that saw the passage of several laws, including the one criminalising instant Triple Talaq, and the abrogation of Articles 370 and 35A - for similar nuggets. The 92-minute long speech saw Mr Modi acknowledge his government's legislative push in its first 75 days in power; riff off the slogan "One nation; one Constitution", with specific reference to Article 370; dwell on his pet themes of Ease of Doing Business, Ease of Living, and Digital India; and address concerns about the economy (the fundamentals are strong, he stressed), but it also featured six interesting messages including the government's latest mission. The emphasis on these to create what the PM calls New India presented a sharp contrast to Pakistan PM Imran Khan's Independence Day speech on Thursday, which focused sharply and largely on India.
The government's latest mission, as first reported in this paper, is Jal Jeevan, on water conservation and providing drinking water to every household. Given the water crisis in many parts of the country - Bengaluru and Chennai, for instance, bore the brunt of water shortage this summer - this is a crucial intervention, one on which the PM said ~3.35 lakh crore will be spent. Water is fast becoming an issue even in the developed world, and it is widely acknowledged that the next wars (civil as well as otherwise) may well be fought over water.
Of the five remaining messages, one, the creation of a Chief of Defence Staff, was more on the lines of an announcement. First suggested after the Kargil war, the idea is aimed at creating a role that can ensure the effective and complete cooperation of the three arms of the defence forces. Increasingly, both offensive and defensive military strategies are seeing a larger role for integration. Another, the economic potential of tourism, is an opportunity (and it's likely, given Mr Modi's popularity, that some will take up his challenge of visiting 15 tourist destinations by 2022).
It's the three remaining messages that are most interesting, especially because they could hint at coming campaigns and pose intriguing questions. The first is on how India can ill-afford a population explosion. With most South Indian states already at the so-called replacement level, this is a message aimed at the other parts of the country. It will be interesting to see how the government follows up on the PM'S message. Will there be incentives or benefits for those with small families? The second is on the insidiousness of plastic. Drains across India are choked with plastic, resulting in flooding. Agricultural land everywhere is loaded with plastic wrappers too - beneath-the-surface testimony to the satchet revolution of the 1990s that was hailed by marketers. Microplastics have already become part of water cycles and food chains - with deleterious health effects. So, will there be a nation-wide ban on plastic of certain kinds (especially single-use plastic)? Will companies that sell chewing tobacco, snacks or consumer products in plastic wrappers be forced to take responsibility for their disposal?
The third is on how India has to celebrate wealth creation and wealth creators. "Wealth creation is a great national service," the PM said. "Let us never see wealth creators with suspicion..." This is a message aimed at highly-paid executives and businesspeople who are upset with the increase in the peak tax rate to 42.7%, and a bout of aggression by the tax department that some have termed tax terrorism. Could the PM'S call mean an end to or even a lessening of this?

PM Modi's sharp response to Imran Khan's shrill attacks is stinging silence

India, Aug. 15 -- In his sixth speech from the ramparts of the Red Fort, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday announced a major military reform that had been stuck for nearly two decades, attacked his critics over Jammu and Kashmir's now-scrapped special status and promised to work to improve the lives of India's billion-plus population. PM Modi also spoke of the many dreams that people had - he invoked the word 46 times in his 92-minute speech -- the ones that his government had for the country and sometimes, the challenges that stood in the way.
But PM Modi's speech did not name Pakistan even once, presenting a sharp contrast to the much-publicised speech by his counterpart Imran Khan less than 24 hours earlier that had focused entirely on India, PM Modi and even the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh.

Khan had even gone ahead to predict that India would take action in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, "more sinister" than the one launched in Balakot after the Pulwama terror attack.
It was a reference to the Balakot air strikes by the Indian Air Force in February this year after a car bombing claimed by Pak-based terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed killed 40 troopers in the south Kashmir district.
"I want to give a message to [Indian PM] Narendra Modi, you take action and we will give a strong response...The Pakistan Army is ready...and the whole country is ready," Imran Khan told the special session of PoK's legislative assembly.

Imran Khan's remarks were seen to be designed to amp up the rhetoric over India's recent moves on Jammu and Kashmir's status and try to internationalise the Kashmir issue.
The only critics of the move that PM Modi responded to were in the opposition.
Without naming Pakistan, PM Modi did make a fleeting reference to terrorism in the world and the region and delivered a quick warning to those who give protection and support. They must be "completely exposed", the Prime Minister said before pledging to destroy those who try to create an environment of fear and terror.
He said India's neighbourhood had been affected by those who those who export terror, referring to terror attacks in Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. By leaving out Pakistan out of this list, PM Modi signaled that Pakistan wasn't a victim of terrorism as the government in Islamabad has repeatedly insisted.

: At the forefront of counter-terrorist operations in Jammu & Kashmir and in the anti-Naxal combat grid, the CRPF has topped the honours list ahead of Independence Day once again, bagging a maximum 75 gallantry medals, including a Kirti Chakra and two Shaurya Chakras.
CRPF's Harshpal Singh has been decorated with the Kirti Chakra, the second highest peacetime gallantry medal of the country, while Zaker Hussain has been awarded the Shaurya Chakra, one below in precedence than the Kirti Chakra, for killing "three dreaded terrorists of Jaish-e-Muhammed" in September last year in Jammu.
Constable Sable Dyaneshwar Shriram of the 53rd battalion of the force was awarded the Shaurya Chakra for killing two armed JeM terrorists after taking them on in Baramulla district of Kashmir Valley while he was on 'naka' (checkpost) duty on October 19 last year.

Vir Chakra For Abhinandan; K'taka's Jadhav Gets Kirti Chakra
The audacious pre-dawn air strikes on a Jaish-e-Muhammed facility at Balakot and the subsequent skirmish between Indian and Pakistani fighters have garnered a dozen medals for the IAF this Independence Day, with Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman leading the pack with a Vir Chakra, the third highest gallantry medal awarded during war or "in the face of the enemy".
In the Independence honours' list, Sapper Prakash Jadhav (posthumously) from the Army's Rashtriya Rifles (RR) and CRPF deputy commandant Harshpal Singh were awarded the Kirti Chakra, the second highest peacetime gallantry award, for "conspicuous bravery beyond the call of duty" during fierce encounters with terrorists in Jammu & Kashmir.
Born in Budihal village in Chikkodi taluk, Belagavi district, Jadhav died in a gunfight with terrorists in 2018. Two terrorists were also killed in the encounter.
There were also 14 Shaurya Chakras in the list, eight from the Army, one from the Navy, two from CRPF and three police officials.
Apart from Wing Commander Varthaman, the IAF gallantry list included Vayu Sena Medals for the five Mirage-2000 pilots who successfully struck the JeM facility with Spice-2000 penetration bombs after crossing the Line of Control in the early hours of February 26. They are Wing Commander Pranav Raj, Squadron Leaders Rahul Basoya, Pankaj Arvind Bhujade, B Karthik Narayan Reddy and Shashank Singh. The commanding officer of a Jaguar squadron, Group Captain Saumitra Tamaskar, who was also part of the overall mission, was also awarded Vayu Sena Medal (gallantry).
A woman ground-based fighter controller, Squadron Leader Minty Aggarwal, who showed exceptional alertness and presence of mind to vector the IAF fighters scrambled to intercept the "strike package" of intruding Pakistani jets a day after the Balakot airstrikes, in turn, has been awarded a Yudh Seva Medal for "distinguished services" during wartime. Four other IAF officers who were part of the planning process for the Balakot strike have also been awarded the same medal.
Squadron Leader Aggarwal, positioned at a radar hub in Barnala, constantly updated the IAF fighters during the dogfight, while also alerting them to the presence of F-16s armed with AIM-120C advanced medium-range air-toair missiles (AMRAAMs).
In the aerial skirmish, with three to four Pakistani jets intruding 6-7km inside Indian airspace, Wing Commander Varthaman in his older MiG-21 shot down a much more advanced F-16 with an R-73 missile by chasing it across the LoC, before he himself was shot down, captured by the Pak army and subsequently released on March 1.
Varthaman will soon take to the skies in a fighter after undergoing the mandatory ground-based tests.
The Shaurya Chakras have been awarded posthumously to Major Vibhuti Shankar Dhoundiyal (Engineers/RR), Lance Naik Sandeep Singh (Para-Special Forces), Sepoy Brajesh Kumar (Punjab Regiment/ RR), Sepoy Hari Singh (Grenadiers/RR), Rifleman Shive Kumar (JAKLI/RR) and Ashiq Hussain Malik (special police officer, J&K).
The other Shaurya Chakra awardees are Lt-Colonel Ajay Singh Kushwah (J&K Rifles/RR), Captain Mahesh Kumar Bhure (Engineers/ RR), Rifleman Ajveer Singh Chauhan (Garhwal Rifles), Amit Singh Rana (Navy), Constable Sable Dneshwaryan Shriram (CRPF), Constable Zaker Hussian (CRPF) and Head Constable Subash Chander (J&K).

Pakistan continues to keep "a sinister eye" on Jammu and Kashmir, sending terrorists into India and disturbing the peace in the Valley, said defence minister Rajnath Singh on Wednesday, while asking the armed forces to "defend the borders to the best of your strength and abilities".
In the customary address on Independence Day-eve, Singh said the armed forces after the Pulwama terror strike on February 14 had "hit back by destroying terror launch pads with air strikes across the border in Pakistan" before it could plan another such terror attack.
Taking note of the anti-satellite missile test on March 27, the minister said the battlefield was no longer limited to land, air and sea but had extended to space and cyberspace. "Therefore, India has to be ready for any eventuality, keeping pace with technological advancements," he said."With the A-Sat test, India joined a select group of nations, like the US, Russia and China, which possess such a capability. However, let me reiterate that defence policy of the country is for peace and stability at the regional, continental and global levels," he added."Since the armed forces are at the forefront of our nation's defence, I assure you that the government will do all that is necessary to keep your morale high and to meet your functional requirements. We are working tirelessly to achieve his vision of 'jointness' among the three wings of the armed forces," said Singh.

Balakot strike was to prevent another Pulwama: Rajnath

NEW DELHI,NATIONAL Pak. is keeping a sinister eye on Jammu & Kashmir, he says India carried out air strikes on a terrorist training camp at Balakot in Pakistan before it could plan another Pulwama-like attack, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said on Wednesday.
“Our neighbour is continuously keeping a sinister eye on Jammu and Kashmir. It sends terrorists into our territory and disturbs peace in the Valley,” the Defence Minister said in his customary address to the armed forces on the eve of Independence Day. Referring to the Pulwama terror attack on February 14 in which 40 security personnel were killed, he said, “Our armed forces hit back by destroying the terror launch pads with air strikes across the border in Pakistan before it could plan another Pulwama-like attack.”
On the anti-satellite (ASAT) test conducted early this year, Mr. Singh said it was done as in the new and emerging world, the battlefield was not only limited to land, air and sea but would also spread to space and cyberspace. “India has to be ready for any eventuality keeping pace with technological advancements in the area,” he said.
“However, let me reiterate that the defence policy is for peace and stability at regional, continental and global level.”
On the welfare of the military personnel, Mr. Singh said he had “restored ‘ration in kind’ for the officers of the three armed forces posted in peace areas since June.”
Now, all officers including those in peace station would get them, he said. The jawans were getting rations in all stations.

Locals stare at long road to normalcy

India, Aug. 15 -- Two events six months apart have shaken Nazir Ahmad Magrey's life: The suicide bombing on February 14 that killed 40 paramilitary troopers barely 100 metres from his two-storey house overlooking the Jhelum; and the revoking of Article 370, which granted special status to Jammu & Kashmir, on August 5.
The bomb attack - he initially thought it was a plane crash -- blew out his windows and shook the frame of his house, bringing the spectre of terror to his doorstep. He was questioned by the local police and the National Investigation Agency (NIA) after the strike that brought India and Pakistan to the brink of war.
The nullification of Article 370, too, ratcheted up bilateral tensions. But Magray fears it can have very personal ramifications: the pulverisation of his fledging timber business and the bottoming out of the local economy that has the potential to hurt young men and women like his son, who is pursuing an undergraduate degree in business administration.
"I fear that in 20 years big industries will take over my business by procuring cheaper raw material from India and selling at lower rates. And, if there is increased competition for jobs, it will only increase despondency among young boys like my son. It may trigger a spike in militancy," he said, venting his disappointment with the mainstream politicians from the Valley who failed to secure the "gift" of Article 370.
As Kashmir reels from an unprecedented lockdown for a ninth day on Tuesday, there is much consternation about what lies ahead for the Valley's five million people on three fronts -- politics, economy and security.
Since the early hours of August 5, politics has been operating in a vacuum in the Valley - with three former chief ministers, prominent leaders of the National Conference (NC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), and at least 500 political workers detained at unspecified locations. But among many locals, there is little sympathy for mainstream politicians, who are seen to have failed to safeguard Kashmir's interests.
"These politicians have failed us, betrayed us. What was their use?" asked Bashir Ahmed, a businessman in Anantnag district's Bijbehara town, considered a stronghold of the Mufti party that controls the PDP. Other voices in Pulwama and Awantipora underlined disappointment in elected leadership and growing support for "Azaadi".
The biggest mass protest since India clamped curfew-like restrictions last week in old Srinagar's Soura last Friday had people chanting Azadi slogans, waving black flags and shouting "India go back" - and the sentiment is carried by a section of those aligned with the administration. "My job is to follow orders and I am doing that. But that doesn't mean I am not angry or hurt. Kashmir doesn't seem like ours anymore," said a J&K police constable on condition of anonymity.
"The move has hurt those who used to carry India's flag in the Valley, their space has been squeezed," said Altaf Hussain, a Srinagar-based political commentator.
What is adding to this sentiment is the widely held view that the redrawing of constituency boundaries - necessitated because the erstwhile state will be broken up into two Union Territories, Jammu & Kashmir with a legislative assembly and Ladakh without one - may hurt Muslim-majority Kashmir, which currently holds 46 of 87 seats, compared to 37 in Hindu-dominated Jammu. "This is a ploy to hurt our autonomy and power," said Muzaffar Wani, a resident of Anantnag. "The NC and PDP have no credibility anymore," said Mukammal Wani in Pulwama.
Mohsin Alam Bhat, executive director of the Center for Public Interest Law at the Jindal Global Law School, said mainstream parties understood that Article 370, and its existence, was key to their relevance in the Valley. "A lot will depend on what the Supreme Court finally decides," he added.
The nerve centre of the Indian government's security response in the Valley is Srinagar's Badami Bagh Cantonment, the army's heavily guarded headquarters of the 15 Corps where officials say there is no fixed time frame for the communications blackout and movement restrictions. "It is important for the Kashmiris to realise that the abrogation of Article 370 is irreversible. Our deployment across the Valley has inherent flexibility to deal with all possible scenarios," a senior army officer said, requesting anonymity. "The restrictions are there for a specific purpose and they are likely to stay in place for as long as required if it helps saves lives," he said.
But security experts worry that this is not a sustainable long-term arrangement.
"For how long can you keep the restrictions imposed? They will have to be lifted at some stage. The security establishment must prepare for the worst-case scenario. The most important thing will be how mass protests are handled because such protests are bound to happen," said Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd), a former Northern Army commander.
The challenge before the security forces once the restrictions are lifted and communications are restored will be stiff, given the mood of local people. "What you are seeing now is government action, a clampdown on our freedom. What will follow is a full-fledged public agitation. This is the lull before the storm," said Pervez Yaqoob, a college student in Anantnag town.
There has been no significant backlash so far as the government has denied "troublemakers" space for their operations by increasing troop-to-ground density and imposing restrictions, said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General BS Jaswal (retd). "How long will the restrictions last? No one can crystal gaze. The government will have to recalibrate its strategy based on how the situation unfolds in Kashmir," he said.
Jaswal cautioned against a surge in militancy in the coming months for two reasons: Pakistan will definitely not want Kashmir to be stable and political leaders with vested interests will make sure that the dissatisfaction arising from the removal of Article 370 accrues.
Kashmir has a home-grown network of industrialists and businesses that mushroomed owing to special privileges for local residents on property, land and setting up factories and industrial units - as part of a broader bouquet of autonomy that was accorded to the region until last week. But now, many residents fear that local wealth will flow out of the Valley.
For example, Magray thinks he will find it tough to compete with Indian businesses with superior supply chains and facilities, and lower rates. He fears his son will remain unemployed because young people from India will flood the Valley and take over jobs.
Bilal Wani, a resident of the old city of Srinagar, thinks that as more locals get restive and disillusioned with the administration, it will hurt businesses more. "Look at these restrictions, we cannot get to our shops. I cannot ply my auto normally or act as a guide because tourists have disappeared. My brother, who sells wares to tourists, has been sitting at home." He said.
Precise economic statistics on the newly carved out union territory of Jammu and Kashmir are not available, as the state-level data also includes Ladakh. Latest available data (2016-17) on per capita Gross State Domestic Product for Jammu and Kashmir shows that it is worse off (Rs 74,998) compared to India (Rs 94,675). However, the recently released Periodic Labour Force Survey shows that unemployment rate in Jammu and Kashmir (4.2%) is less than the all-India average (6.1%).
Restoring investor confidence in the current crisis may not be easy though. Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy data showed that new investment announcements have plummeted in the state in the last three years. Annual growth in value of new investment announcements was -50%, -72% and -94% in the 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19. A former chief of the Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industry said on condition of anonymity that they didn't think the economy would get a boost anytime soon.
"For 30 years, Kashmir's industry has suffered because of violence, this is why industries have not been set up despite several attempts. The current mood in the Valley don't make me think that tensions will ease any time soon."A second former office-bearer of the trade body who is a prominent Valley-based industrialist agreed. "In five years, I will be working for someone else," he said.

Jammu, Aug. 15 -- Indian Railways will deploy its first commando unit - Commandos for Railway Safety (CORAS), to ensure timely completion of rail projects in Kashmir that will connect the Valley with rest of India, the chief of the Railway Protection Force (RPF) said Wednesday.
On the eve of Independence Day, Indian Railways launched its elite commando unit to tackle threats to the country's rail network from left wing extremists, terrorists and subversive elements.
"As far as the scenario in Jammu and Kashmir is concerned, the challenge for the security agency is likely to be formidable post revocation of Articles 370 and 35 A and bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir into two Union Territories. The security scenario has worsened in last two years after the neutralization of Burhan Wani a known terrorist of the area. It is a well known fact that 35 to 40% of terrorist are operating from across the border, but a growing range of local amongst the rank of militant is a matter of concern," Arun Kumar, Director General of Railway Protection Force (RPF) said at the launch of the commando unit.
Railway is currently implementing a project of national importance to connect Katra to Banihal, which is targeted for completion by 2023. The proposed railway line is around 105 kilometres long and 95% of which will be tunnels and bridges. One of the bridges is over the Chenab River.
"With commissioning of this project the majority of transport will shift from the road to rail and integrate newly created UT with the rest of India seamlessly. All our concerns and challenges have now been addressed by commissioning of CORAS," Kumar said. The 1200-member unit will be issued special distinct uniform, latest weapons and equipments. To motivate, the commandos will be given special incentives and allowances at par with other central armed police forces.
"Any disruption in rail network has the potential to compromise national security. While insurgency problem in northeast poses great challenge, the crown of the country, Jammu and Kashmir is facing unprecedented challenge of assimilation, post abrogation of the provision of Article 370 and 35A of the Constitution...," Kumar added.

Kashmir Fallout: Foreign policy front going awry

Jammu, Aug. 14 -- "How our foreign policy was going awry, before August 5, as it is too early to encapsulate the implications and repercussions of the move, but what ought to be known, is to revisit the Sri Lanka Ex President Mahinda Rajpaksa curt statement when he had said 'No' to our NSG troops from landing into Sri Lanka (April 28) in the aftermath of the disastrous Easter Bombings. Big brother was brushed aside."
The step of Narendra Modi government on August 5, abrogating the Article 370 of Jammu and Kashmir, is going to alter the internal and external politics of the country for at least the next fifty years. Congress, PDP, NC, JKPC and the entire opposition was caught unawares, but perhaps, the Modi government started to prepare for it, as it took its first step, when it banned Jamaat-e-Islami in J&K (Feb 28) and thereafter dithered to hold simultaneous assembly elections in J&K, when PDP-BJP government had ended way back (June 19, 2018). The abrogation was well on the cards but Modi panicked and jumped the gun as US President Donald Trump announced twice (July 23&August 2) that Modi had wanted him to mediate on Kashmir issue, which Modi did not deny and answered by annulling Article 370. Pakistan has asked our ambassador to leave Islamabad and also to snap all bilateral trade with India which India has asked to review. Trump is silent then. Modi conferred Ladakh UT status which has irked China. UN has urged both India and Pakistan to exercise maximum restraint and cited Shimla Agreement which states that Kashmir is a bilateral issue.
Narendra Modi when straddled to power on May 23, the political pundits had gone into a spree by attributing Modi's spectacular run, across the whole world in his first stint, to make India become a center stage in the comity of nations, making Indians so proud that even a 'daily-wage labourer' in UP was galvanised, by the packaging of foreign-policy into domestic politics, what to say of educated Indians who all rallied to make it to Modi government 2.0. As after all, Modi went on to strike inside Balakot, no wonder, AS Dulat, former RAW chief had called Pulwama as a gift to BJP before polls.
How our foreign policy was going awry, before August 5, as it is too early to encapsulate the implications and repercussions of the move, but what ought to be known, is to revisit the Sri Lanka Ex President Mahinda Rajpaksa curt statement when he had said 'No' to our NSG troops from landing into Sri Lanka (April 28) in the aftermath of the disastrous Easter Bombings. Big brother was brushed aside. But, why would then Modi re-consider his such an early a visit to Sri Lanka after visiting Maldives (June 8). As if Rakpaksa did not bring enough disdain to our security forces but Modi was so foregone in his 'neighbourhood-first' policy that he met Rajpaksa too! In Maldives Modi got the highest honour 'Nishan-Izzuddin', but no sooner he addressed the Maldivian parliament, Maldivian MP Ahmed Thoriq boycotted and left for outside "to protest the harassment and inhumane actions committed against Muslims in India" something which Thoriq had announced before Modi's arrival. Maldives has supported India on Article 370.
Do we remember the Manmohan Singh Sharm Al Sheikh (July 20, 2009) fiasco in which India's complicity in Baluchistan had come on radar and BJP had then made all hell let loose over it. But, Modi per se took a chance to bolster for Baluchistan freedom movement from the ramparts of Red Fort (Aug 15, 2016), how his government will now comprehend as BLA has been designated a terrorist-organisation by India's strong ally US (July 2). Notwithstanding BJP ally Shiv Sena exhortation to now take POK and Baluchistan. Are our hawks still to pander into staking a Baluchistan government in exile in India?
Closely on the heels was Bishkek SCO visit by Modi (June 13) and our media houses were gaga as to how Modi outsmarted Pakistan PM Imran Khan 'staying together for nine hours' and with only 'a formal handshake', something which has been corroborated by Pakistan PM Imran Khan (August 6) that India was not interested into talking to Pakistan and what he suspected got proved, but what baffled everyone was that our doyen of foreign leaders was left out alone in an odd hotel Orion, 30 kms away from Presidential Palace where all other SCO dignitaries were stationed. Why was Modi left lonely, may be perhaps, he was perceived to be 'quite-more' of a US representative. There are after all no 'free-lunches' in diplomacy.
It can be easily understood the tumult India must have had when whatever that had inveigled between Modi and Trump at Osaka (June 27), only a month later was swiveled by Trump, as he has told Imran Khan ( July 23) that Modi wanted Trump to mediate on Kashmir, which was vehemently denied by Jaishankar Prasad and Rajnath Singh. How Kashmir is now to be presaged, at international level is what has to seen. Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi visited China to mobilise support on Kashmir and now Jaishankar Prasad is also to head to China on August 11.
The Indian betrayal of Iran is almost full circle, as Rouhani may not have as yet convalesced, after he had rushed Javad Zarif to meet Sushma Swaraj (May 14), on the trauma Iran was under, as India has stopped all gas imports from May 2 onwards on outright US dictates. The Ufa, Russia meet of Rouhani and Modi in 2015 turned to be hogwash. Interestingly, it was India which wilted and not China which is also one of the largest importer of Iranian gas. It is construed that India did so out of US support to designate Azhar Masood as a global-terrorist (May 2). Chabahar Port ambitions have now all been floored as India would invest only in double figures (Cr), an amount which equals to any house in Connaught Place. So much so for US but on the contrary US is branding India as a 'tariff king, if India responses with counter-tariffs on US products sale in India and advises India to buy US weaponry to balance its trade figures. This is after upping the ante on India going ahead with Russian S-400 missile defense system but instead to conform to US Patriot Advanced Capability-3 systems. How India will streamline if US goes ahead with a war against Iran can be anyone's guess. Our hardliners are already clamouring for a regime-change in Iran.
There hasn't as yet been even a straightjacket response from the belligerent Hindutva government as Sri Lanka launched its first ever satellite by naming it as Ravana-1 (June 19). This attempt is akin to provoking a war with India particularly when this present dispensation has come to office in the name of Lord Rama, who had killed Ravana-the evil, and had established Ram Rajya. The fact of the matter is that the two political forces in Sri Lanka, the Dravidian Tamils and Sinhalese Buddhists revere Ravana with the same rigour and the analogy of this attempt goes back to millenniums and proves that nothing much has changed.
What will be the way out for US to finally step out of Afghanistan is getting muddy, but India for sure has been asked to walk-out, as US, China, Russia and Pakistan special envoys met in Beijing (July 11) to hammer out a joint-statement for the final settlement in Afghanistan for peace and stability. The Indian efforts to rebuild Afghanistan, in the past two-decades have suddenly drawn cold feet, perhaps India should have rightly observed that Pakistan has legitimate interests in Afghanistan the same way India has in Nepal. Hard times for India may be unfolding with Afghanistan under Taliban going the China way but if the situation escalates over Kashmir, then, US might have second-thoughts over final withdrawal.
Things even in Nepal do not paint a rosy picture as the Indian economic blockades of Nepal (1989 & 2015) still haunt Kathmandu. Nepal knows it well that India badly needs its waters and that Indians send billions of rupees from Nepal as remittances and considers that India needs Nepal more than vice-versa. With the Indian applecart having been badly affected in Afghanistan now what New Delhi desperately wants is to keep China at bay in Nepal. Analysing the Nepal media it becomes amply clear that Nepal does not want to become a RAW republic as reports are agog that RAW chief Samant Goel, on his recent Kathmandu visit(July 23) had opened his purse strings to dubious Nepali politicians. Indian ambassador Manjeev Puri had also openly thrown a dinner to Nepal female MPs to garner support for Indian cause which is nothing but to thwart the proposed visit of China President Xi Jingpin later this year. Meanwhile, it also came to light that Chinese troops had entered 6 kms inside Ladakh and halted Dalai Lama birthday (July 6) and also unfurled Chinese flag. Modi government sources have downplayed the claims.

India, Aug. 13 -- The Centre ordered a clampdown in the Kashmir Valley before ending Jammu and Kashmir's special status to avoid the bloody protests and killings that happened in 2016 after the elimination of Hizbul commander Burhan Wani, the government's top law officer told the Supreme Court on Tuesday.
Attorney General KK Venugopal, who was responding to a petition against the restrictions on movement of people and political leaders in Jammu and Kashmir, said 44 lives were lost in street protests that followed the killing of three militants in 2016.
The judges have declined to intervene for now, and will take up the petition against the restrictions after two weeks.

Venugopal said the government had proof that Kashmiri separatists, acting on instructions from across the border, had instigated people to hit the streets in 2016.
It is this situation and loss of life that the government was trying to avoid, the top law officer told a bench led by Justice Arun Mishra.

MUMBAI
Rumour mill appoints retired Brigadier as Mumbai Police chief

Mumbai,MUMBAI Police officers swing into action to quell rumour after hoax video claiming terror alert has been issued in the country goes viral A retired Indian Army Brigadier based in Pune found himself to be the subject of a hoax video warning of a terror alert in the country that went viral on social media on Sunday evening.
The video was accompanied by a caption in English, which proclaimed that the man was the Commissioner of Police, Mumbai, and claimed that he was issuing a terror alert in light of the recent abrogation of Article 370, which granted special status to the State of Jammu & Kashmir.
By Monday, the Maharashtra Cyber department had identified the man as retired Brigadier Hemant Mahajan, who regularly appears on news channels as an expert on matters of national security.
Speaking toThe Hindufrom Pune, Brigadier Mahajan said, “Around four days ago, a news channel had sought my opinion on the fallout of the removal of Article 370. It was the news channel’s information that a terror alert has been issued by intelligence agencies, and I only referred to it while moving on to my thoughts on the subject. And as it was raining very heavily on that day, we mutually decided that I would record a video of myself and send it to them. How that same video has become viral as a terror alert is neither something I know nor something I can control.”
The video’s caption said, “Mumbai Police Commissioner. Total Mumbai under terrorist attack... be careful. All railway stations... bars or any theatres and auditoriums... all public places. Please forward to all groups. Jai Hind. Jai Maharashtra (sic).” The 1.54-minute video shows Brigadier Mahajan talking about the situation in Jammu & Kashmir in Marathi. However, nowhere in the video does Brigadier Mahajan identify himself as the Mumbai Police chief.
Dressed in a formal shirt and tie and seated in a semi-lit room, with a curtained window in the background, Brigadier Mahajan is seen in the video speaking in Marathi. He says, “Intelligence agencies have issued an alert saying that after removal of Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan, its army and its intelligence agency ISI will try to incite violence in Mumbai. They have said that 19 cities in the country are under risk and have issued an alert. Security at airports and other important installations has been increased. Please remember one thing that if there is any kind of attack on the country, we have the capability of protecting our people from it. But when a terrorist attack occurs, or when a bomb blasts happens, security is anyway increased but they might fall short, so it is important for citizens to participate as well and be alert about what is going on around us.”
Brigadier Mahajan goes on to elaborate why it is important for the city’s residents to stay alert, “An attack is bound to happen somewhere some time and being alert 365 days is the only thing we can do because Pakistan will surely do something. They are capable of it. There is no need to be afraid, but it is important to stay alert and help the security agencies.”
Two hours after the video surfaced, officers of the Mumbai Police viewed it and went about quelling the rumour that the man in the video was the Mumbai Police Commissioner. Following the clarification, the rumour died down. The Cyber police then initiated inquiries into the matter.
Brigadier Mahajan said, “I received a call about the matter on Monday morning, which is when I realised that my video was being misused. I am still thinking as to whether to file an official complaint on the matter."

NOIDA, Aug. 13 -- The Member of Parliament from Gautam Budh Nagar constituency Dr Mahesh Sharma, along with Kashmiri Pandits, on Monday welcomed the effective scrapping of Article 370 by the government.
Dr Sharma recalled memories of 1990s, when Kashmiri Pandits were driven out of Kashmir valley by terrorists, and forced to shift to Noida and Delhi. Many Kashmiri Pandit families were settled in Noida, which was a new, well-planned and developing city in Uttar Pradesh, the MP said.
"Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah have taken a historic decision by abrogation of Article 370 because now we hope that we can rebuild our houses, which were destroyed by terrorists. I saw terrorists killing my sister and father in my house and then suddenly we had to leave to save our lives. Our 12 kanal land was grabbed by terrorists in Pampore. Now we hope to get it back and justice delivered to us," said Ramesh Mota, who started crying while narrating the incident.
Around 100 Kashmiri Pandits were present at the Kailash Hospital Hall where Dr Sharma organised the event to celebrate the abrogation of Article 370 that gives special status to the Jammu and Kashmir.
Another Kashmiri Pandit, Kamal Hak, said the abrogation of Articles 370 and 35-A will benefit every community and not just the Kashmiri Pandits.
"There will be peace, development and opportunities for all communities in Jammu and Kashmir. In the last 70 years, the people of Jammu and Kashmir kept suffering as many privileges were not being passed on to them. But now things will change because all government schemes will reach the people there," said Hak.

Hyderabad: Members of the Muslim Rashtriya Manch (MRM), a wing of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), will burn the effigy of Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan and Pakistan national flag across the country including Telangana and Andhra Pradesh on August 14 - Pakistan’s Independence Day.The protest has been planned to denounce Pakistan-sponsored terrorism in India, particularly in Jammu and Kashmir. The agitation has gained significance in the wake of bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir into Union territories and abrogation of special status granted under Articles 370 and 35A of Constitution.In Telangana, MRM activists will burn Pakistan’s flag and Khan’s effigy in Hyderabad and district headquarters towns. A similar protest has been planned in Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh. On August 15, MRM activists will fan out all over Telangana and hoist the tricolour marking India’s 72nd Independence Day.
The national flag will be hoisted at about 700 locations in the state and about 8000 places across the country. Chittoor, the native place of former chief minister and TDP president N Chandrababu Naidu, has been chosen for the Independence Day celebrations in AP. Chittoor has a considerable Muslim population and the TDP, which was in an alliance with BJP till last year, contested alone in the recent assembly elections. MRM leader Dr. Azmatullah is overseeing the arrangements in Chittoor district.The BJP, which won four Lok Sabha seats in Telangana in the recent general elections, plans to widen its electoral and political base in the state ahead of municipal polls later this year. The party has also set its eyes on the 2024 general elections.The national convener of MRM, Girish Juyal told TOI that MRM activists will unfurl the tricolour on August 15 to infuse patriotic feelings. Besides celebrating the Independence Day on a large scale even in far-off areas, MRM has planned to take up a campaign in tribal areas involving Muslim youth. Juyal said the idea is to bridge the gap between different communities for national unity and integration. MRM Telangana convener MA Sattar said MRM patron Indresh Kumar has given the call to celebrate August 15 and organise protests on August 14. Shahid Akhtar, MRM national convener incharge of south India and Virag Pachpore, national convener incharge of Telangana and AP, will supervise the MRM activities.“We are committed to Hindu-Muslim unity. We will promote good will between communities through flag hoisting. Many problems can be sorted out if we understand and respect the sentiments of each other,” he said, adding that the protest against Pakistan will be held at Afzalgunj and Musheerabad. Syed Fayazuddin, MRM co-convener, Telangana, said local Muslim youths and students will participate in the protest on August 14. “It is a big event. We want to send a strong message to Pakistan that we will not tolerate terrorism and separatism,” he said.

Decoding PM's Speech on Kashmir: 10 Counter Questions
By Prof Ujjwal K Chowdhury.
1455 words
12 August 2019
Kashmir Times
HTKAST
English
© 2019. Kashmir Times
Jammu, Aug. 12 -- 1. "The people of Jammu and Kashmir and those of Ladakh were being denied their rights. But a new era has now dawned on Jammu and Kashmir. Now every citizen in the country has equal rights and responsibilities.": PM Narendra Modi.
Who has denied their rights? National Conference which was Congress partner all along? Or PDP, which was BJP partner in the last state government? Terrorists? That is for central governments to counter. In fact, Art 370 gave a few additional rights to people of J&K, now taken away. How do all Indians have equal rights when Indians from other places still cannot buy land, do business, or settle permanently in several states of India in Northeast and Himalayan part of North India? Yet, now others can do so in J&K which may alter the demographics of the region and make locals more vulnerable.
2. "There are times when things become stagnant and they don't change. Articles 370 and 35A were harming the people of Jammu and Kashmir, and they were being used as a tool by Pakistan. Nearly 42,000 innocents died in the last 30 years".: PM Modi
How were these laws being used by Pakistan? Pakistan was funding and training terrorists who were dismissive of Article 370, in fact. It was the repeated use and abuse of AFSPA law by Indian state and the terror attacks with Pak support which were making Kashmir stagnant. Surely people died due to terrorism and militancy, but how is Art 370 responsible for that? In fact, militancy in Kashmir was helping Pakistan to get more aid from the West and arms from China, helping local politicians get some Delhi or Pak patronage, helping terror network with funding and training from Pakistan (& China), and helping Indian Army have AFSPA cover and Central government an unusually stronger say in the state. Only the common people were on the losing side sandwiched between these vested interests of various proportions.
3. "Jammu and Kashmir didn't develop at the pace it rightly deserved, but its people will have a brighter future now. The parliament used to pass laws that benefit the people, but Jammu and Kashmir could not benefit from them because of Article 370.": PM Modi.
Just a set of comparative figures of J&K and PM Modi's home-state Gujarat. Life expectancy at birth is 74 years in J&K, 69 in Gujarat. Under five mortality rate is 38% in J&K and 44% in Gujarat. Ratio of above 15 years with at least 8 years of schooling is 87% in J&K and 75% in Gujarat. Ratio of underweight children is 17% in J&K, 39% in Gujarat. Ratio of rural population below poverty line was 12% in J&K in 2012, and 22% in Gujarat. Wages of male rural labourers in 2012 were Rs.209 a day in J&K and Rs.116 in Gujarat. All these, in spite of long-drawn terrorism, militancy and State excesses in the region. So who needs more 'special care'?
4. "The 1.5 crore people of Jammu and Kashmir did not even benefit from education laws drafted for the entire nation. Children in Jammu and Kashmir didn't even get the right to education. What was their crime?": PM Modi.
As figures above show, school-going students are far more in J&K than even Gujarat. And their education has been hampered by repeated curfew and restrictions for right and not so right reasons over 30 years. State and Central governments should have contributed to education and healthcare here in a much bigger way.
5. "There are laws to prevent atrocities against Dalits, but they couldn't help Jammu and Kashmir. There are laws to protect minorities, but none in Jammu and Kashmir. Workers there never got their guarantees and rights. But things will get better now that Articles 370 and 35A are history.": PM Modi
Kashmiri society has almost no Dalits, and the proportion of Dalits in Jammu is also much lesser than North India due to predominance of Pandits. Workers' minimum wages in J&K are far higher than those of many Indian states. Dalit exploitation among workers, hire-and-fire approach etc are far lesser in Kashmir.
6. "I don't think there will be a need to keep Jammu and Kashmir as a union territory for long, although the status will be retained for Ladakh. Jammu and Kashmir will touch new heights of development and attract people from the world over.: PM Modi
If J&K would not be a union territory for long, then why demote now far down from constitution protected special status? The will of the people represented through Legislative Assembly, usurped by the Governor after forced dissolution of the elected Assembly (remember, that NC-PDP joint letter not reaching Governor due to 'No Fax Machine working in Rajbhawan' lie?), and Governor's rights usurped by the Centre, then using majority in Parliament, ruling party deprived the rights of the region and demoted it to two union territories. Yet speaking of 'protection of rights'? And their own interest being guarded by locking them up in homes for 5 days now? If this measure was in Kashmiri interests, why lock them up, and arrest even moderates and pro-Indian politicians?
7. "I urge businesses to come forward to develop the region, because we need to take its products across the world. Ladakh has a huge potential for eco and religious tourism, and it can also be a solar power hub.": PM Modi.
Is this an invitation to Indian and MNC big business to come and exploit the natural resources and pollute the culture there and make super profits, while locals remain at subsistence level, as in many Indian states? Where are the promises of Rs.10,000 crores worth development package given by PM Modi along with CM Mufti Mohammad when PDP-BJP government came to power as an alliance only five years ago?
8. "Many policemen and officers have died over the years. They all dreamed of a better Jammu and Kashmir. We have to work to achieve their dreams. I thank and congratulate the security forces, the police and the administration for everything they have done.": PM Modi.
Why not give Rs.1 crore to their kins as done by the Delhi government actually in many cases of deaths on duty? Why mere words? Shah Faesal (35), who topped the Indian Administrative Services (IAS) examination in 2010, even resigned from the government services, citing "marginalization and invisiblization of around 200 million Indian Muslims at the hands of Hindutva" as a reason. So, has the administration been happy with strong arm tactics of the Centre (Congress and BJP governments included)?
9. "The situation will normalise soon, and the difficulties will reduce correspondingly. You will continue to have MLAs, you will continue to have a cabinet, you will continue to have a Chief Minister. The only thing you won't have is terrorism.": PM Modi.
They already had MLAs, cabinet and government, now taken away forcibly and through lies recently by the same government which is promising these to Kashmiris today. And, after changing their status literally at a gun-point, why this presumptuous statement that terrorism will die? History shows, when coerced, every society has gone towards more violence and terrorism.
10. "Some people opposed the government's move, and I respect their opposition. That is essential in a democracy. But I urge them to act in the nation's interests, and help the government in creating a new environment of peace and development in the region.": PM Modi.
Where is the space for opposition and the contrarian view? Not a single voice of a directly affected Kashmiri from the valley in any national TV or paper now as all are under lockdown. No doubt all should contribute towards peace and development.
Jammu & Kashmir's statehood needs relook, and humane touch to assuage grievances must replace the use of brute force in the valley. We have denied their rights decided by the leaders of 1947-50, and plebiscite as promised was never held. If PM Modi means what he says (unlike his heady BJP-PDP alliance bonhomie days), there must be visible action on ground to ensure the free movement and dignity of general Kashmiri citizens. The Eid should not be a dark Eid in the valley this year.

Move on Article 370 will end terror: Shah

New Delhi, Aug. 12 -- Union home minister Amit Shah said on Sunday that the revocation of special status to Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 of the Constitution will bring an end to terrorism and result in development of the region.
Shah said he believed Article 370 needed to be removed as it was not beneficial for the country. "I was firm that Article 370 should be removed... after (scrapping) Article 370, terrorism in Kashmir will end and it will progress on the path of development," he said .
"I was firm that this has to be removed from the Constitution. Now, with its removal, Kashmir will witness an end to terrorism and it will proceed on the path of progress," the home minister said. The Centre had last week stripped Jammu and Kashmir of its special status and split it into two union territories - J&K and Ladakh. Despite the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) lacking majority in the Rajya Sabha, the Jammu and KashmirReorganisation Bill was first tabled in the Upper House of Parliament and it was passed, he said.
The bill was subsequently got the Lok Sabha nod and became a law after Presidential assent on August 9.
Recalling his association with Naidu, Shah said he had not come to attend the event as the home minister, but as a "humble student of Venkaiah Naidu". "His life, right from a college student leader to the Vice-President, itself is a lesson for everyone. I have learnt a lot from him," Shah added.
Regretting his inability to address the gathering in Tamil, Shah said though official preoccupation had deterred him to learn the language, he would one day speak in Tamil.
Speaking on the occasion, actor Rajinikanth praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Shah for the revocation of Article 370, going to the extent of describing the duo as "Lord Krishna and Arjuna". The Tamil mega star, known to be close to the saffron party and its leadership, is yet to launch his political party but has declared to contest the state assembly elections, due in 2021.
"Hats off to Home Minister Amit Shah for 'Mission Kashmir' operations and my wholehearted congratulations for the feat. The way you handled it was exemplary and the speech you delivered while tabling the bill was fantastic...fantastic sir," Rajinikanth said, adding the Prime Minister Modi and Shah were like Lord Krishna and Arjuna.
He also described Venkaiah Naidu as a "complete spiritual person" and a leader who is humane and one who is concerned about the welfare of the poor. Earlier in the morning, Tamil Nadu BJP leaders, including state party chief Dr Tamilisai Soundararajan, called on Shah at the Raj Bhavan while chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami met him separately.

Intel says Jaish suicide squad in Valley for attack

A seven-member suicide squad of the banned Jaish-e-Muhammed has infiltrated into Jammu & Kashmir to carry out a massive terror attack on Eid or ahead of Independence Day, top intelligence sources told TOI on Sunday.
The sources said Pakistan's ISI had given the goahead to the group headed by Masood Azhar, designated a global terrorist, to cause as many casualties as they can without worrying about "collateral damage".
Security officials suspect Jaish-e-Muhammed will primarily target a mosque so that Pakistan is able to pin the blame on India. The group is also likely to attack civilian traffic and security installations along the highway in Anantnag district, they said.
Intelligence inputs about the likelihood of such an attack have come six days after Parliament passed a bill to nullify Article 370 and turn J&K and Ladakh into separate Union Territories.
Police sources said the Jaish suicide squad had possibly entered the region south of Banihal and the Pir Panjal mountain range. "We suspect they sneaked into J&K from Rajouri or Poonch district," a top official said.
Azhar's brother Abdul Rauf, who is in charge of the group's terror operations, is believed to have plotted the suicide mission. He had planned and executed the 1999 hijacking of the Kathmandu-Delhi Indian Airlines flight IC 814.
Intelligence sources said Rauf met ISI officials in Rawalpindi to finalize the plan and returned to Bhawalpur after sending the suicide squad to J&K.
According to security analysts, Pakistan is desperate to draw international attention after its attempts to whip up a frenzy over the J&K developments were dismissed by the US and several Muslim countries. "Terror is the only effective strategy that they are left with now that India has concreted integration of J&K with the rest of the country," a counter-insurgency expert said.
Pakistan, he said, also wants to demonstrate to separatists in the Valley that it will continue to support terror and protests there. Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan tweeted against India on Sunday, comparing the BJP government with genocidal Nazis.

Lucknow: A group of 24 prisoners from Jammu and Kashmir, including those arrested in recent terror activities, were shifted to Lucknow district jail on Saturday amid tight security of Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS), provincial armed constabulary (PAC) and district police teams. The district jail is located in Gosainganj. In last three days, 26 prisoners from Jammu and Kashmir were shifted to Agra Central Jail and 20 others to Bareilly district jail. A district administration official said the prisoners were brought in an aircraft that landed at Indian Air Force’s airbase at Bakshi Ka Talab from where they were taken to Lucknow district jail in three trucks escorted by security forces.A jail official confirmed that total 24 inmates have been shifted to Lucknow jail, but refused to share their profiles. “They all have been kept in separate barracks under highest level of security. They are all under CCTV watch,” the official said.
Another official said the prisoners shifted to Lucknow are mainly from separatist groups, those arrested in fomenting violence, stone pelting and having past track record of trouble-making for breach of peace.Officials at DGP headquarters, meanwhile, told TOI that as per norms of Union ministry of home affairs, they are not allowed to reveal details about the transfer of inmates under special circumstances.

A fist-full of earth for the Pulwama martyrs

Bhopal: A 39-year-old Bangalore resident has redefined patriotism in his own way.It’s been almost four months that Umesh Gopinath Jadhav to have left his home to collect a fist-full of earth from near the homes of the 40 Pulwama martyrs, who were killed in the terror attack in Kashmir on February 14, from across 16 states in the country.Jadhav, an event manager and an ardent guitarist, is in the City of Lakes on way to his next destination — Maharashtra. “My main objective is to reach Pulwama by February 14, 2020, to pay tributes to the 40 martyrs who laid down their lives for the cause of the country.”About his mission, Jadhav, whose only companion in the journey of thousands of kilometres is the guitar, said: “Though I have travelled some 12,000 km so far, I do not know how much more I have to travel,” he said.Since most of the houses of the Pulwama martyrs are in the interiors, it takes time to find their address.
So far, he has covered nine martyrs in the states of Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Karnataka, Maharashtra. He would be leaving for Jabalpur after August 15.Sharing his experience of 12,000 km, Jadhav said that the common factor that binds the Indians from Kanyakumari to the places he visited is the 'nationalism’. “I might have met hundreds of people so far, and all of them have shared their sentiments of nationalism, and hailed my efforts of reaching Pulwama with a 'fist full of earth’ as mark to pay respect to the soldiers who selflessly sacrificed their lives for the country."He added that the journey has been an experience of a lifetime. “After knowing about my mission, people come forward to help me in cash and kind,” he said recalling one such incident, “In Nagpur, a group of people helped me with a new tyre after seeing my worn out tyre.”“The most convenient place for me to stay at night is at a petrol pump,” he said, adding, “The petrol pumps are equipped with toilets and the employees are cooperative and allow me spend nights."Apart from his Mission Pulwama, Jadhav said that another main objective is about the well-being of the parents of martyrs. “The assistance is mostly for wives and children of the martyrs, but government does not provide any assistance to ageing parents,” said the 39-year-old. He said that he would raise the issue of providing assistance to parents that they do not have to depend on others after the sacrifice of their bread-winners.Jadhav has also been visiting schools and colleges to create awareness about the sacrifices made by the soldiers.He has been toeing a car. “Most of the houses of martyrs are in the inaccessible areas, so it becomes easy for me to travel on bicycle and meet the families.”About his most interesting point so far on his mission, Jadhav said that when he started his mission, there were 29 states, and he had planned accordingly. “But, by the time I reached Bhopal, the number went down to 28, with Kashmir being made into a Union Territory,” said Jadhav, adding that he had change his plan a little bit.

As LoC tension mounts, over a dozen terror camps reactivated in PoK

NEW DELHI: As tension between India and Pakistan escalates over scrapping of special status to Jammu and Kashmir, Islamabad has hastily reactivated nearly a dozen terror camps in Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK) and close to the International Border along Jammu and Kashmir.During the past week, hectic movement of terrorists has been seen around these camps which were almost shut in the wake of May 2019 deadline set up by Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an inter-governmental body based in Paris. Top intelligence sources said Indian security forces have been put on high alert as terror camps in Kotli, Rawalkot, Bagh and Muzzafrabad in PoK area, bordering Line of Control (LoC), have been reactivated with the ostensible backing of Pakistan army.Two days back, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan had stated in the joint session of Parliament that Islamabad would not be responsible if Pulwama type (or even bigger) terror attack is executed in India.
The all important statement of Imran Khan has virtually granted liberty to terror outfits such as Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and their handlers in Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency of Pakistan, to reactivate training camps and launch pads.Intelligence reports reveal that more than 150 cadres of JeM, LeT and veteran Taliban have reportedly gathered at Fagoosh and Kund camps near Kotli and Shavai Nallah, Abdullah Bin Masud camps in Muzaffarabad area. JeM's chief Maulana Masood Azhar's brother Ibrahim Athar was also spotted in the PoK area, intelligence reports said.Highly placed sources in the security establishment said National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, who is currently in the Valley, had a high level meeting with senior officials which included Intelligence Bureau Director Arvind Kumar, Director General of Police, Jammu and Kashmir, Dilbagh Singh, and top Army brass. The NSA discussed security strategy and terror threat from across the border in the backdrop of government's bold decisions taken on Jammu and Kashmir.Sources said security agencies acknowledge the fact that in the cross-border shelling during the past fortnight, a few groups of fidayeen of JeM and LeT reportedly infiltrated into the high reaches of Kashmir. Various strategies have been put into action to neutralise these foreign mercenaries.Earlier last week, Indian forces foiled major infiltration bid by Pakistan's Border Action Team (BAT) on forward post along the LoC in the Keran Sector, killing at least five intruders. In a week's time BAT made four infiltration bids which were successfully foiled by Indian forces.Apart from the LoC area, terror outfits continue to train cadres inside and outside PoK. In Khyber Pakhtunwa area, veteran Taliban cadres have a strong foothold. Revealing details of terror activity in Mansehra (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa), sources said terrorist training camps are located in Jangal Mandi, Shinkiari, Boi, Garhi Habibullah, Oghi, Elaqa-e-Ghair, Attar Shisha, Skardu base camp, Andher Bela and more.Sources said that several terror camps have been dismantled while in some camps, there is no activity at present. Although under pressure of possible sanctions by FATF, the list of active camps in Pakistan has been reduced significantly, but the fact remains that terror factories still continue to operate on its soil.Intelligence agencies have handed over a precise list of operational and non-operational terror camps to Indian security forces, sources added.

Kolkata: Domestic flyers departing Kolkata have been asked to report at least three hours early for check-in because of a high alert following intelligence inputs on a terror strike at Indian airports in the wake of the recent developments pertaining to Jammu and Kashmir and Independence Day next week. Passengers’ vehicles are being checked outside the airport and there is manual frisking at multiple points inside.
This is likely to continue till the end of the month.In a tweet on Wednesday night, Kolkata airport authorities said, “In view of the increased security measures due to the forthcoming Independence Day, passengers travelling out of Kolkata airport are requested to report early for check-in to avoid missing their flight.”The advisory was issued days after the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security issued an alert saying all metro airports were vulnerable after the “recent developments pertaining to Jammu and Kashmir” and hinted that civil aviation was a soft target for terrorists.The alert will be in force till August 31, till any further order. Airport authorities said that while security is enhanced every year in the run-up to Independence Day, it is more stringent this year due to higher threat perception. “We are organizing random intensive checks on the city side of the airport. Suspicious vehicles are being stopped and checked thoroughly using under-view mirrors and security personnel are manually inspecting the vehicles’ boots and interiors,” said an airport official.The official added that the bomb detection & disposal squad, armed with latest gear and sniffer dogs, have been posted outside the airport and two quick response team vehicles have been stationed at two ends of the airport.The deployment of CISF personnel has been doubled at the entrances and exits of the terminals. “The additional personnel have been deployed to ensure none slips out of the zone without furnishing necessary documents. Armed security men have also been kept on guard in case a terrorist attempts to barge in. Entry of visitors accompanying flyers is banned for the time being,” said a CISF official.Inside the terminal, over 24 plainclothes personnel have been deployed to conduct random scanning of passengers on the move. At the security check point, passengers are being asked to remove shoes, belts and every other accessory and pass them through the scanner. For registered baggage, a second layer of manual checking has been introduced after the X ray scan.CISF officials said the additional security measures are holding up each passenger at least an hour to 90 minutes more and are leading to long queues that almost reach the gates during peak hours. “We have started sending texts to flyers to report at least three hours before the flight departure,” said an official of an airline.

Navy put on high alert amid 'heightened threat perception' after Centre revokes J&K's special status
Rajat Pandit

NEW DELHI: The Navy has gone on a high operational alert. It has activated its warships and shore-based bases for any conventional contingency as well as to prevent any terror attack emanating from the sea, like the 26/11 strikes that rocked Mumbai in November 2008.The Navy is keeping its "eyes and ears open" on both the western and eastern seaboards. They are also alert along the country’s 7,517-km coastline in conjunction with the coast guard, amidst the "heightened threat perception" after the Modi government revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir and moved to split the state into two union territories, said defence officials on Thursday.The Army and IAF are already maintaining high operational readiness to cater to all eventualities, with the former also further strengthening its counter-infiltration and counter-terrorism grids in Jammu and Kashmir.
"Pakistan might step-up ceasefire violations or activate sleeper cells for big terror strikes in the run-up to August 15," said an official.The Navy, apart from deploying warships, Dornier and P-8I maritime patrol aircraft, is also keeping a hawk-eye on the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) through the Information Fusion Centre-IOR at Gurgaon. The centre takes feeds and inputs from multiple sources ranging from coastal radars to satellites and then fuses, correlates and analyses them to assess threats in the maritime domain.India has taken several steps to bolster coastal security as well as better coordination between intelligence and security agencies since the hijacked fishing vessel Kuber slipped through the cracks to allow Ajmal Kasab and nine other terrorists to reach Mumbai. They unleashed mayhem that eventually killed over 160 and injured over 300 during the 26/11 attacks.A big problem is that that the over two lakh smaller fishing vessels still cannot be effectively tracked because they do not have AIS (automatic identification system) transponders on board. "The trials for fitting the transponders on such vessels have been successful off the Tamil Nadu and Gujarat coasts. But the issue of who will pay for the transponders is yet to be worked out," said a source.The Phase-II of the Coastal Surveillance Network (CSN) is also far from being completed. Under Phase-I of the CSN, 36 radar stations on the mainland, six in Lakshadweep and Minicoy and four in Andaman and Nicobar became operational at a cost of over Rs 600 crore after several delays.The Phase-II, which will cost over Rs 800 crore, involves setting up 38 more radar stations with static radars and electro-optic sensors, four mobile surveillance stations and integration of VTMS (vessel traffic management systems) sites in the Gulfs of Kutch and Khambat.Once all fishing vessels are fitted with proper identification systems, coupled with the digital registration of all boats by the 13 coastal states and UTs, the radar network will get the "brains" to identify them dynamically. But this is still quite some distance away.

J&K move: The real test begins now
Brahma Chellaney
827 words
9 August 2019
Hindustan Times
HNTM

Copyright 2019. HT Media Limited. All rights reserved.
MUMBAI, Aug. 9 -- Afinal deal between the United States (US) and the Pakistanreared Afghan Taliban appears imminent, with the Taliban saying major differences have been resolved. Pakistan's key role in this process, and in the implementation of the deal that emerges, has emboldened it to downgrade diplomatic relations, and suspend bilateral trade with India - actions that New Delhi itself should have taken long ago against its terrorism-exporting neighbour.
In fact, US President Donald Trump's looming Faustian bargain with the Taliban was an important factor behind India's change of the constitutional status of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K). A resurgent Pakistan-Taliban duo controlling Afghanistan would spell greater trouble for J&K, including increased crossborder entry of armed jihadists.
Jammu and Kashmir's reorganisation effectively compartmentalises India's territorial disputes with Pakistan and China centred in that region. China's protests that India's inclusion of the China-held Ladakhi areas in the new Ladakh Union Territory "hurts Chinese sovereignty" underscores that there will be no let up in incursions. In recent years, China - which occupies the Switzerland-size Aksai Chin Plateau, and lays claim to several other Ladakh areas - has stepped up its military forays and incursions into Ladakh's Demchok, Chumar, Pangong Tso, Spanggur
Gap, and the Trig Heights.
The immediate trigger for rejigging the constitutional status of J&K was Trump's Af-Pak gambit. The US president has beseeched Pakistan to "extricate" them from Afghanistan. The paradox is that the US is stuck in the longest war in its history because of Pakistan, which harbours the Taliban's command-and-control base. Yet Trump, after accusing Pakistan of "lies and deceit", is now appeasing it, including by slightly reopening the military-aid spigot, and offering twice to mediate the Kashmir conflict, even though such an offer is a red rag to the Indian bull.
It is against this background that, to level the field, J&K's special powers and privileges were revoked, Ladakh was carved out as a separate entity, and the misogynist Article 35A was repealed. For India, three decades of a Pakistan-backed Islamist insurrection in the Kashmir Valley made the status quo no longer sustainable. Armed jihadists today call the shots in the Valley, from where the virtually entire indigenous minority - the Kashmiri Pandits - were driven out in one of modern history's most successful and swiftest ethniccleansing operations.
Even if India had maintained J&K's special constitutional status, Pakistan would have continued its low-intensity asymmetric warfare. After all, Pakistan is a revisionist State that seeks to redraw borders in blood. Yet Pakistan, far from granting autonomy or special status to the two parts of J&K it holds (the sprawling Gilgit-Baltistan, and the so-called Azad Kashmir), has treated them as its colonies, recklessly exploiting their mineral and water wealth, and transforming their ethnic and linguistic identities through demographic change.
Today, nothing is encouraging Pakistan more than Trump's turning to it to "help us out" in Afghanistan. Pakistan's brutal proxies have compelled the US to negotiate the terms of its Afghanistan surrender and seek Pakistani support for a face-saving exit. Just days after the US reached a tentative deal with the Taliban in late January, a suicide bombing claimed by a Pakistan-based terrorist group killed 41 Indian paramilitary soldiers.
Now, with a final deal in the offing and the elected Afghan government sidelined, a scofflaw Pakistan has sought to turn the tables on India by ironically lecturing it on international law and expelling the Indian envoy, even as India still treats Pakistan as a terrorist state only in rhetoric, not in actual policy terms. It will not be long before Pakistan's roguish military also ups the ante against India, either directly or via its non-uniformed soldiers - the terrorist proxies.
India, through the J&K constitutional change, has pre-emptively sought to safeguard its security before America hands Afghanistan back to the same terrorist militia it removed from power in 2001. But India has a history of losing the advantage after a potentially game-changing move. After Balakot, Pakistan was quick to neutralise India's advantage with a daring aerial blitz that crossed a red line by targeting Indian military sites. Yet Pakistan escaped scot-free.
India's real test begins now after the bold, legacy-shaping J&K action. Indeed, the government needs to tackle head on the protracted proxy war of a renegade neighbour that, far from becoming diplomatically isolated as sought by India, has been emboldened by Trump's gambit.
Does India have the political will to impose costs in a manner to make them increasingly unbearable for Pakistan?

NEW DELHI: Internet services continue to remain suspended for the second successive day in Jammu and Kashmir on Wednesday. According to Software Freedom Law Centre, a civil society organization that tracks such instances, J&K has seen 53 such shutdowns in 2019 alone.According to SFLC's project, Internet Shutdowns, J&K has seen 176 instances of clamp down on internet service since 2012, the highest in the country.

Jammu, Aug. 8 -- Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday strongly defended his government's decision to revoke Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, saying the provision has not given anything except separatism, corruption and family rule to the state, and Pakistan has used it as a tool to spread terrorism.
The Prime Minister said that the statehood, except the Union Territory Ladakh, would be restored to Jammu and Kashmir 'once the situation in the State becomes normal.'
In his televised address to the nation, Modi hailed his government's decision to revoke the Article as "historic" and said a new era has begun in Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh.
"The dream of Shyama Prasad Mookerjee, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Sardar Vallabhai Patel and crores of Indians has now been fulfiled," he said. Asserting that no one has been able to justify how the Article 370 and Article 35A was benefitting people of the state, the Prime Minister said these provisions did not give anything except separatism, corruption, terrorism and family rule. Attacking Pakistan, which has termed India's move as "unilateral and illegal" and strongly protested by downgrading diplomatic ties, Modi said Pakistan used Article 370 as a "tool to spread terrorism."
"In last three decades, over 42,000 people lost their lives," he said, adding, "We will rid J&K of terrorism and separatism under new measures." He also said over 1.5 crore people of J&K were being denied benefits of legislations meant for the entire country.
Spelling out his government's development plans for J&K, he said state government employees including police would soon get benefits on par with employees of other Union Territories and all vacant posts in Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh would be filled, creating employment opportunities. He also assured people of J&K that they would get opportunity to elect their representatives in a transparent way. "As J&K will see more and more development. I do not think it will remain Union Territory for long. Ladakh will remain the UT," Modi said.
Earlier this week, the Union government revoked Article 370 to withdraw special status to J&K and bifurcated the region into two UTs --Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh. They also got Parliament nod for it.
Modi told the people of Jammu and Kashmir that their representatives will come from among them only.
"Just like you had MLAs and Ministers, you will have the same. Just like you had a CM, you will have your CM. I have full faith that under this new arrangement, we will destroy terrorism and free J&K. We all want that in the coming times, the Legislative Assembly elections are held in Jammu and Kashmir. A new government is made, a CM is elected. I assure the people of Jammu and Kashmir that they will be given a chance to choose your representatives in a transparent manner. The way Panchayat elections were held with transparency, Legislative Assembly elections will take place in the same way. I would like to request the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir that he expedites the process of the formation of the Block Development Council, which had been lingering on over two-three decades," Modi said.
He exhorted the film industry to start shooting films in Jammu and Kashmir again, saying as the situation returns to normal, crews not only from India but abroad too will descend on the picturesque state. In his address to the nation days after Parliament approved abrogation of special status to Jammu and Kashmir and cleared a bill to split the state into two union territories--Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh--Modi recalled the time when Kashmir was a favoured destination for Bollywood film shoots.
"There was hardly any film which was not shot in Kashmir ... now situation will normalise in Jammu and Kashmir. Then people not only from India but world over will go there to shoot movies," he said. The 1964 hit 'Kashmir ki Kali', 'Jaanwar', 'Three Idiots' are some of the movies shot in Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. Known the world over for its shikaras, lakes, snow-clad mountains and lush green meadows, Kashmir had been a favoured destination of the filmmakers both from the Bollywood and regional cinema. "Every film will bring along several employment opportunities ... I request the Hindi film industry, Telugu and Tamil film industry and people associated with it to certainly think about investment in Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, from shooting to establishment of theatres," he said.
"I have full faith that when the Panchayat members will get a chance to work after the withdrawal of Article 370, they will do wonders. I am sure that the people of Jammu and Kashmir will defeat separatism and move forward with new hope. I am absolutely certain that the people of Jammu and Kashmir, in the environment of good governance and transparency, will achieve their objectives with enthusiasm," he said.
"We have tried to bring transparency and new sort of work culture in the Jammu and Kashmir administration. As a result, there is fast-paced progress in the work of IIT, IIM, AIIMS, irrigation projects, power projects, or anti-corruption bureau. You will be surprised to know that thousands of brother and sisters in Jammu and Kashmir, who had the right to cast their ballots in the Lok Sabha elections, could not vote in Legislative Assembly and local body polls. These are the people who came to Pakistan after the partition. Should such injustice be continued with these people?" asked PM.
He said that it would be the priority of the central government under the new arrangement that the employees, J&K cops get equal benefits as enjoyed by their counterparts in other states. "Very soon, vacancies in Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh will be filled. This will help local youth to get employment opportunities. The Public Sector Units and the private sector will be encouraged to provide jobs. In the rest of the country, Safai Karamchari Act is in place for Safai Karamcharis. However, people of J&K cannot get its benefit. In the rest of the country, there is a strict law against atrocities against Dalits; however, it was not applicable in Jammu and Kashmir. The Minorities Act to protect the minorities is applicable in all the states of the country, except J&K. In other states of the country, the Minimum Wages Act is applicable for the welfare of the labour, but in Jammu and Kashmir, it is only on papers," Modi said.
"The law which is made after debates and discussions prove to be beneficial for the entire countrymen. However, no one imagines that the laws made in Parliament are not applicable to a part of the country. Sometimes, it is believed that nothing will change, it will work like this. There was a similar sentiment with Article 370. There was no discussion about the loss of our people in Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. Surprisingly, if we talk to anyone, no one could even tell what was the benefit of Article 370 in the lives of the people of Jammu and Kashmir. These provisions did not give anything to J&K except separatism, corruption, terrorism and family rule," he added.
"Like one family, one nation - we have taken a historic decision on Jammu and Kashmir. Such a system, due to which the people of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh were deprived of many rights, which was a major obstacle in their development, has now gone away. The dream of Sardar Patel, Baba Ambedkar, Shyama Prasad Mookerjee and Atal Bihari Vajpayee and crores of patriots have been fulfilled," he said while congratulating residents of J&K, Ladakh and all Indians.

India, Aug. 8 -- Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that Article 370 and 35A were used by Pakistan to kill 42,000 people. The contentious laws only helped "terrorism, separatism, nepotism and massive corruption," he added before a "historical" decision on Jammu and Kashmir could be taken by his government. He was speaking in his Address to the Nation on Thursday evening.
"#Article370 and #Article35A had only given terrorism, separatism, nepotism and massive corruptions; these Articles have been used as a weapon by #Pakistan, killing atleast 42,000 people, "?he said adding, "Jammu and Kashmir could not develop due to the old laws".
"A big obstacle to development of Ladakh and Jammu Kashmir has been resolved due to the common resolve of all countrymen. It is the beginning of a new era for Ladakh and Jammu Kashmir," he said.
Article 370 was treated as permanent by force of habit despite its temporary nature, he added explaining why it had taken so long to repeal this special provision that "wasn't benefiting anyone".
Follow Live Updates from Prime Minister's address to the nation
"There was no debate on Article 370, when asked no one was able to say how the Article benefited them. These provisions only contributed to terrorism and corruption," said the Prime Minister.
Prime Minister Modi's assertion comes after Pakistan unilaterally downgraded ties with India and sent the Indian envoy back to New Delhi.
India responded by asking Pakistan to reconsider its decision which New Delhi said was taken to present an alarming picture of bilateral ties to the international community. India also added that Pakistan had no business commenting on India's internal matters including Jammu and Kashmir.
Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan also said Thursday that Islamabad was looking at political and legal options to challenge India's termination of special status granted to Kashmir.
Imran used "fascism" to describe actions of the BJP government.
"What should be obvious is the international community will be witnessing the genocide of the Kashmiris in IOK. Question is: Will we watch another appeasement of fascism, this time in the garb of BJP govt, or will the int community have the moral courage to stop this from happening?" Imran Khan was reported as saying.

Filmmakers make a beeline to register titles on Article 370

Soon after the Indian Air Force's strike in Balakot on February 26 in response to the Pulwama terror attack, Bollywood producers thronged the offices of Indian Motion Pictures Producers Association (IMPPA), Producers Guild of India and Indian Film TV Producers Council (IFTPC) to register film titles - post the success of Uri: The Surgical Strike barely a month ago, the event was identified, among other things, as premise for another potential blockbuster. Names like Pulwama: The Deadly Attack, Surgical Strike 2.0, Balakot and Pulwama Attacks, among others were blocked within no time. One particularly visionary filmmaker claimed a title referring to IAF pilot Abhinandan Varthaman, who had received a hero's welcome after being held captive across the border for 60 hours.
Now, the Central Government's decision to repeal Article 370, which granted Jammu and Kashmir special status, has elicited a similar reaction. Between Monday and Tuesday, over 50 titles pertaining to the historic move are believed to have been registered at various Hindi film bodies. "Taking a cue from the success of Article 15, the titles Article 370 and Article 35A are the first choice of most filmmakers. The associations have received at least 25-30 applications for them," reveals a source close to the development, adding that the more theatrically-inclined ones have opted for titles like Kashmir Mein Tiranga, KashmirHamara Hai, Dhara 370 and Dhara 35A. The source goes on to reveal that top production houses are also entering the fray. "Some of them are keen to seek permission at the earliest to make a film on the event so that they can proceed with the research, cast and get other logistics in place."Trade analyst Atul Mohan points out, "Filmmakers had rushed to register titles around the Uri attacks, Pulwama attacks and demonetisation as well." Anand Pandit, producer of the PM Narendra Modi biopic featuring Vivek Oberoi, downplays the timing of the phenomenon by saying that he had already registered the titles Article 370 and Article 35A a month ago. "I wanted to explore why one state was granted such privileges. But after the historic redrawing of our map by our Prime Minister Narendra Modi, I have just found the perfect ending for my film. From a film based on history, it is now going to be a historic film," he says. Filmmaker Vijay Galani also insists us that he has been working on a script set in Kashmir for a while now, and given the current political scenario, Article 370 makes for a perfect title. "Following the decision on Monday, someone suggested that I get two titles - Article 370 and Article 35A - registered," he shares.

'It's in your hands': NSA Ajit Doval tells security personnel in Kashmir

India, Aug. 7 -- On a visit to Kashmir just before the presidential order stripping Jammu and Kashmir of its special status was issued, National Security Adviser Ajit Doval reached out to civilians in the valley, broke bread with them and gave security personnel deployed in the hot-bed of Kashmir militancy a pep talk.
"The country's leadership, its future depends on how capable our forces are, how trained they are and how high their morale is," he told a group of security personnel in south Kashmir's Shopian. He continued: "It will depend on how big a sacrifice you are ready to make to achieve your objectives".
NSA Ajit Doval's choice of Shopian is crucial.
NSA Ajit Doval interacts with locals in Jammu and Kashmir's Shopian
The district, located south of the Pir Panjal mountain range, is considered the gateway to the Kashmir valley. Holding this region is also important because it can provide terrorists free access to cross over to Doda, Kishtwar and Poonch area of Jammu.
Pulwama, the district where a Jaish suicide bomber had killed 40 CRPF soldiers in February this year, is just 20-odd km away. Shopian, often described as the ground zero of Kashmir's terror, is also where Hizbul commander Burhan Wani was killed in a deadly encounter with the forces in 2016 sparking violent protests across the valley.
This is also one of the four Kashmir districts - Pulwama, Kulgam and Anantnag were the other three -- that have been the focus of counter-terror operations this year which led to the elimination of 101 terrorists in the first five months of the year.
Like Zeenat Naikoo, the local anchor to Jaish's foreign terrorists who cross over from Pakistan, who was killed in an encounter last week. Or the top commander and bombmaker of Jaish-e-Mohammed Munna Bhai who was eliminated a week earlier.
Doval's visit came in the context of the internal security establishment's assessment that there could be attempts to incite street protests besides a spike in terror attacks. This is one reason why there had been multiple visits to Kashmir by top security experts over the last month, right from the NSA to the chief of the army and intelligence chiefs.
Doval returned to the national capital satisfied. In a report to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the NSA said residents of the state were supportive of Centre's initiative to scrap Article 370.

Mumbai could be Jaish's target, says Indian intelligence

New Delhi, Aug. 7 -- Jaish-e-Mohammed, the Pakistan-based terrorist group, is looking to scale up attacks on security forces in Jammu and Kashmir as well as economic targets in cities such as Mumbai, intelligence agencies have told the government.
The assessment comes a day after Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan declared that India's decision to revoke the special status of Jammu and Kashmircould lead to "Pulwama-like incidents", even trigger a conventional war between India and Pakistan.
It is a statement that is being seen as an indication of Pakistan attempting to ramp up its support to terror groups, even push terror groups to throw all that they had.
Also Article 370 I 'Intel input on possible attack in Mumbai:' Sources to HT
A senior security official told HT that around the time Imran Khan made the statement, came news that Rauf Azghar, the younger brother of Jaish chief Maulana Masood Azahar had moved up to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir after meetings in Rawalpindi yesterday.
Rauf Azghar's shifting closer to the border between the two neighbours ties in with reports emanating from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir about a large number of Jaish recruits shifting from its camps in Punjab towards the border.
In the hinterland, a top government official said, the intelligence establishment assesses that there could be attacks against some infrastructure and economic target.
The intelligence bureau suspects the Mumbai could be one of the targets on the radar of the Jaish-e-Mohammed, an official said, attributing this assessment to a string of inputs that had been received.
This set of inputs includes intelligence reports that a three-member Jaish team had been assigned the task of carrying out an attack in Mumbai and local sleeper cells had been activated.
The security establishment had anticipated much of these emerging developments.
This is the reason why National Security Adviser Ajit Doval landed in Jammu and Kashmir for a last-minute review of the security preparations with army and paramilitary commanders along the Line of Control and beyond.
The Centre had also told state police agencies to step up security at key places.

Terror factory in Pak working overtime to create trouble across border: Army

Pakistan is cranking up efforts to push as many infiltrators as possible across the line of control into Jammu and Kashmir, while also calibrating crossborder terrorist actions and disinformation campaigns to inflame passions among Kashmiris, said Northern Army Command chief Lt-General Ranbir Singh on Tuesday.
A day after the Modi government revoked the special status of J&K and moved to split the state into two Union Territories, the Indian Army's assessment is that there is mounting pressure on the Pak Army-ISI combine within Pakistan "to show visible action" on the Kashmir front.
This could range from stepped-up ceasefire violations along the LoC, with caliber-escalation to artillery guns and heavy mortars, to planning a major terror strike in J&K in the run-up to the Independence Day on August 15. As per the Army, there are around 200 active terrorists in J&K at present, with another 200-250 positioned at the terror launch pads along the LoC waiting for opportunities to infiltrate across.
Pak army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa, on his part, declared his force "firmly stands" by the Kashmiris in "their just struggle" to the very end. "We are prepared and shall go to any extent to fulfil our obligations in this regard," he said, at a meeting of his corps commanders summoned on the "single-point agenda" of Kashmir in Rawalpindi on Tuesday.
The Indian Army, incidentally, foiled two infiltration attempts in the Machhil and Uri sectors along the LoC in the intervening night between Monday and Tuesday, in which a soldier was injured and later evacuated to a hospital."The infiltrators in both the bids were forced to retreat under heavy fire. In the one at Uri, they left behind three AK assault rifles, three pistols and 13 under-barrel grenades around 500 metres inside Indian territory. It could be a new tactic to dump weapons on our side of the LoC for retrieval later," said an officer.
Lt-Gen Singh held a toplevel meeting of security and intelligence agencies at Srinagar on Tuesday to review the operational readiness to meet any contingency that could adversely impact the security situation in J&K.
Pakistan has "intensified its efforts" at increasing the number of terrorists in launch pads along the LoC, initiating ceasefire violations, pushing infiltrators across the border, calibrating terrorist actions in the hinterland, as also exploiting the social media to launch disinformation campaigns in J&K, he said."The Indian Army is given a befitting response, thwarting their (Pakistan) nefarious designs of causing disturbances in our country-…If Pak Army continues with this disruptive course, the Indian Army will respond with resolve and that the cost would be prohibitive for them," said Lt-Gen Singh.
Stressing that all necessary security arrangements have been put in place to ensure peace and security, the top officer urged people in J&K to "not fall prey to the enemy's evil designs to poison their minds with incessant propaganda", while also exhorting them not to "proliferate rumours as well as dissuade their near and dear ones from indulging in rumour mongering".

OPINION
Kashmir has been cut to the quick

OPINION The Centre is riding roughshod over Kashmiri public opinion already beset with disaffection In the face of a massive security build-up in Kashmir at the close of July, a seasoned journalist conjectured, “This is just the right time when militants and their masters in Rawalpindi could do with a terror attack in Kashmir.” Such were the arguments trotted out by experienced media persons in seeking to account for the extraordinary lock down that had descended on Kashmir throwing its citizens into a panic, with a run on banks, petrol pumps and stores across the Valley. I began receiving phone calls from friends and associates as far as Gopalpora, Mattan and Doabgah and Sopore asking what was happening. My former colleagues in government, some in key positions, had no inkling and made dire predictions.
A steamrolling
And then we had the statement of the Home Minister, Amit Shah, in the Rajya Sabha on the morning of Monday August 5, 2019. Under Article 370 of the Constitution of India, the State of Jammu and Kashmir had its own Constitution and its own laws, with the President of India empowered to decide which provisions of the Indian Constitution would be applicable within the State, but only with the assent of the State.
In one fell swoop, the President, Ram Nath Kovind, declared that all provisions of the Indian Constitution shall now apply to the State, thus nullifying Article 370 with the use of that same article thereby ending the special autonomous status of Jammu and Kashmir that it had enjoyed since the promulgation of India’s Constitution. The Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Bill 2019 further bifurcates the State of Jammu and Kashmir into two Union Territories, both with a Muslim majority namely: the Union Territory (UT) of J&K and the Union Territory of Ladakh. While the UT of J&K will have a legislature, the Union Territory of Ladakh will be without one. Although in the past UTs have been upgraded to States, never has a State been downgraded, thus bringing to a consummation the process initiated with the accession, although hardly in the manner dreamt.
Umbilical link
Article 370 has governed the accession and relationship of the princely State of Jammu and Kashmir with India under the Indian Constitution. As originally envisaged, Article 370 formed the basis of Kashmir’s special and autonomous status. Mainstream political leaders such as Farooq Abdullah, Mehbooba Mufti and others have warned that revoking Article 370 will mean a break in the relationship between the State and India.
A devout Muslim, the then unchallenged Kashmiri leader, Sheikh Abdullah (Baba-i-Qaum to his people), ‘faced a clear choice in 1947; he could join a Muslim nation or he could join a secular state, where Kashmiris would be free to live a life of their own choosing. In making his choice, India’s Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru was the Sheikh’s reassurance. Of Kashmiri descent, a heritage that Nehru cherished, Nehru had an inclusive vision of what India was to be’. By contrast, the leader of the newly emerging nation of Muslims, Mohammed Ali Jinnah, was a cold and distant figure, a modernist who could excite awe but little affection. At the time of accession, the portion of the State where Jinnah’s Muslim League had its support lay not in the Kashmir Valley but across the Pir Panjal, in Mirpur and the old Poonch principality of the feudal State of Jammu and Kashmir, an area a large part of which Pakistan occupies today and calls ‘Azad Kashmir’.
It is important to remember that the Kashmir freedom movement was a movement to rid Kashmir of despotism, working in tandem with the national movement but not part of it. This was primarily a Kashmiri movement drawing almost universal Kashmiri support in a Muslim majority State where the Kashmiris were the largest single ethnic group. Despite efforts by Maharajah Hari Singh’s Prime Minister Ram Chandra Kak in eliciting the Sheikh’s support for Independence, the latter stood steadfast in his demand for an end to the monarchy.
Visiting Srinagar on June 18- 23, India’s Viceroy Lord Louis Mountbatten urged Hari Singh not to make a declaration of independence. He conveyed Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s message that ‘the States Department was prepared to give an assurance that, if Kashmir went to Pakistan, this would not be regarded as unfriendly by Government of India’. It was only when Jammu and Kashmir forces faced an uprising by the Poonch troops of the British Indian Army’s decommissioned Sixth Punjab Regiment (in the border district of Poonch), and then a military rout by invading frontier tribesmen in the State’s border town of Domel on October 22, 1947 that the Maharaja turned in desperation to India.
Pakistan’s lost cause
According to the 1941 Census, 77.11% of the population of Jammu and Kashmir was Muslim, 20.12% Hindu and 1.64% Sikh. Pakistan has argued that the logic of Partition meant that the State had to be a part of Pakistan. But by recourse to an invasion by Pakistan’s frontier tribesmen and the support of the invasion by Pakistan’s armed forces, Pakistan virtually lost its case, certainly in the eyes of Kashmiris. India’s case rested on the public will. Indeed, Sheikh Abdullah spoke for Kashmir at the United Nations in February 1948 as part of a delegation led by N. Gopalaswami Ayyangar firmly declaring, “We shall prefer death rather than join Pakistan. We shall have nothing to do with such a country.” And it was this freedom within the Indian Union that Abdullah sought through the constitutional guarantee of Article 370, which read with Article 369, provided temporary powers to Parliament to make laws for J&K.
Under sub-section 3 of this Article, the President of India can revoke Article 370 only on advice from the Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir. The Constituent Assembly was dissolved in 1957, and replaced by a Legislative Assembly, which was dismissed last year after the coalition between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Democratic Party collapsed and the Governor Satya Pal Malik rejected a bid for an alternative coalition. Importantly, the current Presidential order modifies Article 367 of the Constitution, with “Constituent Assembly” to be read as “Legislative Assembly of the State” and the State government construed as the Governor. This has enabled the President to abrogate Article 370 with the consent of the Governor as consent of the State. The people themselves, who the Constitution is designed to serve, therefore, had no part in this process. The constitutional validity of these amendments are for the Supreme Court to ponder. But the question here is that if these are indeed designed to benefit the people, was it necessary to bring them before Parliament under stealth, with the leaders of mainstream parties, the former Chief Ministers the Abdullahs (father and son), Mehbooba Mufti and the BJP’s ally Sajjad Lone all under house arrest?
Opaque moves
There is little doubt that these are bold constitutional measures described with contrasting adjective or invective, consummating a process that began with the Constitution of India. But if the view of government was simply to rectify a constitutional error or remedy an anachronism as claimed by assiduous government spokesmen, did it not follow that democratic compulsion required that it be placed before the public most affected — the people of J&K, — before being sneaked into Parliament in tight secrecy? This without the knowledge of even the local government amidst security measures unprecedented in their intensity, surpassing even those that the Jagmohan government was forced to take following the outbreak of insurgency in 1989-90? This endeavour has meant riding roughshod over Kashmiri public opinion already beset with widespread disaffection. What it has succeeded in doing is leading to a feeling of betrayal among a section of our people and foreboding among well wishers of Kashmir.

Kin of martyred CRPF men hail Centre’s move on J&K

PATNA: The family members of CRPF personnel martyred in the Pulwama terror attack in February this year praised the NDA government at the Centre for revoking the special status to Jammu & Kashmir under Article 370 of the Constitution. Ram Niranjan Thakur (48), who lost his son Ratan Kumar Thakur in the Pulwama attack, said it is a historic decision. “My joy knew no bounds after the government’s move. It is a real tribute to my son, who lost his life for the sake of the country,” he said.Thakur, whose second son Milan Kumar has been appointed as a clerk in Bhagalpur secretariat on compassionate grounds, praised PM Narendra Modi. “I had full confidence in him (Modi),” he said and added, “We feel pride whenever such occasions arise and people contact us. My son’s sacrifice will never go in vain.
It was the Pulwama attack which compelled the central government to take such a decision.” Mithilesh Singh (50), the elder brother of slain jawan Pintu Singh of Begusarai, said had such a decision been taken earlier, many lives (of jawans) would have been saved. “The bloodshed in J&K due to terror strikes in recent years would have been stopped had Article 370 been revoked,” he said.Mithilesh, a farmer by profession, said the news brought smiles on the face of Pintu’s widow Anju Singh. “It’s like a dream come true for the family. Such news gives solace to the families of martyrs, albeit temporarily,” he said, adding that he would thank PM Modi for his historic decision.The family of another martyred CRPF jawan Sanjay Kumar Sinha of Taregna Dih near Masaurhi in Patna rural praised the central government’s move. “He (Modi) is a visionary PM. We had full faith in him that he will do something in J&K. That’s why people voted him to power for the second consecutive term,” said the slain cop’s father, Mahendra Prasad (65). Prasad said no other leader than Modi would have done it.

Ranchi: Families of martyrs and war veterans have hailed the Centre’s move to revoke the special status given to Jammu & Kashmir and its residents, calling it historic and progressive from the country’s perspective.Brice Soreng, father of Pulwama terror attack martyr Vijay Soreng, told TOI, “We welcome the move. Had such a bold step taken a few years back, probably my son and many like Vijay would have lived today. Personally, I am content at heart with this news.”He maintained that splitting J&K and Ladakh into separate Union territories is what people in that region, too, had been demanding for long. “Pakistan probably was misreading by claiming that the locals demanded freedom from India.
Today’s move by the Modi government may have upset political parties and pro-terrorist sympathisers, but not the common residents there,” he said over the phone from Gumla.Anuj Ekka, grandson of Paramveer Albert Ekka, who was martyred in the 1971 Indo-Pak War, said he is happy that local youths can now aspire to dream big. “The sense that I get from today’s development is that whatever is happening is for better control and governance. This means, youths will be able to avail government’s welfare schemes, reservation benefits, job opportunities, cross-cultural exchange and so on. Further, they will now not be caught in crossroads,” he said. Martyred Albert Ekka’s family currently resides in Simdega district.Khunti-based Ursena Bhengra, whose husband Anthony Bhengra (212 Rocket Regiment) took part in the 1991 Kargil War and was declared as missing so far, hoped that the troubled zone is revived into a true paradise. “Kashmir is called a paradise. With this change, I hope, the government will seriously work to convert J&K into a true paradise and not fail its people and several jawans who laid their lives to save the country’s integrity,” she said.Agrees Suman Horo, whose husband Rafale Horo (Corps of Signals) died in Srinagar in 2010 during cross-border counter operations. “We are a free country and everyone can now move freely,” she said.War veteran Umesh Singh, who was part of Operation Vijay in Kargil, said for the first time, the government is on the front foot to counter Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. “Now, no one can claim any part of Kashmir as theirs. It has been with India and will always be so. In the last 70 years, Article 370 and 35A prevented these regions from development. The time has now come where kids and youngsters will no longer be poached to work as human bombs or stone-pelters,” he said.

UDHAMPUR, Aug. 6 -- In the backdrop of the prevailing situation in Jammu & Kashmir, the General Officer Commanding in Chief, Northern Command, Lt Gen Ranbir Singh chaired a meeting of the Core Group of Intelligence and Security agencies at Srinagar to review the operational readiness to meet any contingency that could adversely impact the security situation in J&K. He stated that necessary security arrangements had been put in place for ensuring peace and security.
The Army Commander highlighted that during the past few days, Pakistan had intensified its efforts at increasing strength of terrorists in launch pads along the Line of Control, initiating Ceasefire Violations, pushing infiltrators across the LoC, calibrating terrorist actions in the hinterland as also exploiting the social media to launch disinformation campaign in J&K. Indian Army has given a befitting response, thwarting their nefarious designs of causing disturbances in our country. He urged the people not to fall prey to the enemy's evil designs to poison their minds with incessant propaganda and exhorted them not to proliferate rumours as well as dissuade their near and dear ones from indulging in rumour mongering.
He warned that if Pakistan Army continued with a disruptive course, the Indian Army would respond with resolve and that the cost would be prohibitive for them.
Giving details of security of the hinterland, it was highlighted that counter terrorism and law & order grids had been strengthened. The security forces are suitably deployed to guard important Vulnerable Points/ Areas, prepared for crowd control, emerging law & order situations, as also to conduct effective counter terrorist operations.
The Army Commander stated that security forces were maintaining a high state of alertness and readiness to counter any inimical designs. Serving a note of caution to those who harbour plans to disrupt peace and harmony within, GOC-in-C stated that they would be dealt with firmly.
Overall, the Security Forces are firmly in control of the security situation. The Army Commander complimented all agencies for their synergised efforts to ensure peace and security in Jammu and Kashmir.

Declare Mehbooba Mufti a terrorist, jail her under anti-terror law: Shiv Sena

India, Aug. 5 -- The Shiv Sena has said former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Mehbooba Mufti should be declared a terrorist and sent to jail for speaking the "language of terrorism" under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Amendment Bill, 2019.
The Sena's comments came in its mouthpiece Saamana on Monday, came hours before the BJP-led central government scrapped Article 370, a constitutional provision that grants a measure of autonomy to Jammu and Kashmir.
Article 370 of the Constitution grants special status to Jammu and Kashmir, while Article 35A empowers the state legislature to define the state's "permanent residents" and their special rights and privileges. Article 35A was introduced through a presidential order in 1954 to continue the old provisions of the territory regulations under Article 370.

"Mehbooba Mufti has given warning over Article 35A. She has said that whoever will repeal Article 35A their hands will be set ablaze, people of Kashmirshould stay ready for sacrifice, she said this echoing the language of separatists. The home minister should not tolerate this. This is the language of terrorism," the Uddhav Thackeray-led party said.
The editorial was referring to the comments made by Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) leader Mehbooba Mufti while addressing the 20th foundation day of her party in Srinagar on July 28.
"The home minister has made anti-terrorism law strong and got it passed in Parliament. As per this law, any person can be declared a terrorist and can be taken into custody. As per this law, Mehbooba Mufti should be declared a terrorist and sent to jail, otherwise, her plan to create violence in Kashmir will get successful," the editorial added.
The Sena said just like the decision to bring in demonetisation was known only to a handful of people within the Narendra Modi government, the plan for Kashmir too is privy to Modi and a couple of more key people. It said that in the last week 10,000 additional troops were sent to Jammu and Kashmir and now another 28,000 men are going to be deployed.
It also said that people have to come out of this delusion that the issue of Kashmir can be solved with dialogue.
"The Kashmir issue can be resolved with the use of the army and the time has come. If home minister Shah is preparing for any such action, the people of the country will stand beside him in support," the editorial added.
The Sena also expressed its "concern" over the suspension of Amarnath Yatra and pilgrims being asked to leave the state.
The resolution to revoke Article 370 was moved in Parliament following intense speculation for the past two weeks about a 'big decision' on Kashmir. The government announced the changes hours after a security crackdown began in Kashmir and restrictions on the movement of local political leaders, including Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti.
Telephone and internet services remained suspended and movement of the public in the main Srinagar city was also restricted since midnight. Schools were ordered shut as well.

What's happening in Kashmir?
By Anuradha Bhasin Jamwal.

Jammu, Aug. 5 -- Kashmir Valley has witnessed much worse threats and turbulent periods but never before were tourists hurriedly packed up to leave. Nor was Amarnath yatra cut short in view of threat perception. So, why does a recovery of cache of one sniper and couple of landmines make the government so unnerved that they have lost the confidence in the ability of the security forces, despite all the additional forces being despatched to the Valley, to ensure safety and security of the pilgrims and the tourists? The Amarnath pilgrimage and pilgrims remained undisturbed when a lesser known militant group Harkat-ul-Ansarannounced to attack the yatra in mid-nineties. It went on smoothly during the turbulent summers of 2008, 2010 and the far more volatile 2016 after Burhan Wani was killed. So, either the threat this time is exceptional or the security apparatus has lost its grip over Kashmir.
Friday's hurried developments deepened the panic which was already building up in the last one fortnight or so. While pilgrims and tourists were being returned and official advisories to this end were being signed, the durbar move employees from outside Kashmir were being asked to pack up and leave in a day or so, in a hush-hush manner. The District Development Boards in all the districts of Jammu and Kashmir were abolished by the Governor who later appealed for calm and asked people not to pay heed to any of the rumours.
It would be important to know where these rumours are originating from and then inspiring wild speculations about an apocalyptic future. Last week 10,000 extra security troops were marched to Kashmir, over and above the 40,000 that had been deployed at the start of the Amarnath yatra, with no clear explanation. A further addition of 28,000 troops were sent to Kashmir before this arms haul was made and displayed, followed by reports of returning pilgrims.
Why is all this not making sense? After the extra-troop deployment more than ten days ago, mysterious government circulars hinting at troubled times ahead, the BJP leaders strongly batting for revocation of Article 35A, Jammu & Kashmir Police issued a note to all its Superintendent level officers to provide list and details of mosques located across the Kashmir valley. The details sought included the name of the mosque, ideological affiliation, name of the local imam and the management head.
There have been a series of developments that first gave rise to speculations and circulation of rumours that the Centre may attempt to do away with the contentious Article 35A (that defines the permanent resident of Jammu and Kashmir which enjoys special status under Article 370 of the Indian constitution). On Friday, the speculation of BJP government declaring Kashmir and Ladakh as union territories and giving Jammu a separate state status become far more fashionable.
All these trends have the potential of instilling panic and anxiety in a population that have lived in decades of violent and chaotic conditions. Sense of panic is not a novelty or abnormality in Kashmir. Perpetuated by history, unfulfilled political aspirations, a conflict and chronic distrust of New Delhi, it has been a part and parcel of the Valley's landscape and politics for years. Centre's flawed policies, often peppered by insensitivity, pursued by successive governments in the last seventy years and the mischievous machinations of vested interests in and outside the state have ensured that the Valley remains in perpetual chaos and panic mode. Under the right-wing Bhartiya Janata Party, which makes no secret about its pathological contempt for all Kashmiris, this panic has surpassed all previous limits.
Is there truth in the speculations about revocation of Article 35A, UT status for Kashmir or of further augmenting the military method of dealing with Kashmir? The speculations are based on recent developments over which the government has failed to clear the mist. They are taking birth from official actions and announcements, not random rumours. Are the successive developments merely coincidental or is there a larger pattern and method in this madness?
While the union government is maintaining cryptic silence as the Valley is sinking into a deeper morass of chaos and uncertainty, the officials at the local level have ended up confounding the confusion in the name of clarifications.
Jammu & Kashmir police officials had called both the extra-deployment of 10,000 troops and the profiling of mosques as "routine" security drills, explaining that the police maintains records of all religious places and that the extra-troops were being sent for replacing the troops already operating in the Valley, reports in the national media, quoting unnamed government sources, linked the movement of troops to intelligence inputs of a major terrorist attack threat in KashmirValley. The extra troop deployment announcement incidentally came two days after visit of National Security Advisor, Ajit Doval to Kashmir. Last week, Vijay Kumar, Advisor to Governor Satya Pal Malik, however, added yet another dimension to the issue, saying that the extra troops were meant for the ongoing Amarnath yatra. 40,000 extra troops have already been deployed for the two-month long pilgrimage that culminates on August 15, also the country's Independence Day. Now another 28,000 has been added, strangely before the government arrived at the conclusion that there was such a massive threat to the Amarnath pilgrimage that it cannot be handled at all.
Speaking to media-persons last week, Advisor Kumar almost washed his hands off the matter of enhanced panic. He said, "If somebody is causing panic or rumour on the social media, then I should not be countering it. What is the source of this rumour? It won't be proper for me to keep reverting every time."
Can the government be spared of the onus of responding to rumours? A quick recap of recent events would suggest not. The Valley has been in a tizzy for almost three weeks, starting from Governor Satyapal Malik's shocking suggestion to militants to kill corrupt politicians instead of security personnel, a remark he later admitted he shouldn't have said but made no apology for. BJP president Ram Madhav on a visit to the Valley said that the Article 35A and 370 would have to go lock, stock and barrel. More than 10 days ago, RPF Assistant Security Commissioner (Budgam) Sudesh Nugyal issued a communique to his employees to stock ration for at least four months, store drinking water for seven days and fill vehicles fully to deal with the issue of law and order for a long period as there is a "forecast of deteriorating situation" in Kashmir. (As a belated damage-control response, the officer was transferred.) The letter was widely circulated on the social media, triggering panic. The learned Advisor of the Governor may only have to look within the administrative apparatus to see where the source of rumours lies before trying to shrug off responsibility.
Whether by design or by default, the government has allowed chaos and panic to sink in. Refusing to take responsibility, it is further confounding the confusion, confirming people's suspicions of a sinister plot. Speculations are rife in the Valley about what the BJP-government is trying to achieve and why. Would the BJP embark on the dangerous course of tampering with the laws defining the special status of the state, at the risk of intensifying the strife in the Valley as well as creating a constitutional crisis? Does it wish to augment chaos in the Valley to ensure low polling percentage in Legislative Assembly elections that it can take advantage of to fulfill its ambition of full majority in Jammu and Kashmir? Or, is it hoping to use Kashmir yet again as a prop with an eye on the forthcoming elections to different state assemblies? Is the government going on an over-drive after US president Donald Trump's Kashmir mediation remarks?
The eeriness of what is happening and the mysterious behaviour of the government and official agencies bears an uncanny resemblance to 1990s when Jagmohan took over as Governor of the state. What followed is already well documented. One possibility is a more aggressive form of Jagmohan's crackdown on Kashmir. More blood and gore, perhaps. Whatever, the design, it appears the end-result would be a complete gulf between people of Kashmir and New Delhi and a fillip to militancy and the more hardcore Islamist ideology.
The sense of deepening mistrust in Kashmir of New Delhi under the BJP can be gauged from two traditional adversaries Peoples Democratic Party and National Conference making attempts to create a larger political network to meet the prospective challenges in the light of these fresh development. This is the second time that the two parties have joined hands after they staked claim to government formation last December, unnerving the BJP and prompting the Governor to hastily dissolve the assembly without any sound logic. That time, the BJP was putting its weight behind its potential Kashmiri ally, Sajad Lone's Peoples Conference and hoping to cobble up a BJP coalition government by effecting defections from other parties. Lone, however, now appears as clueless and as smitten by the BJP as the rest. Last week, he rapped the BJP government of engaging in "dangerous adventurism" and on Friday he attended a meeting called by Mehbooba Mufti to discuss the emerging situation.
The Valley's politics reveals an exceptional response to a situation of uncertainty. That is primarily because the situation is exceptional, beyond the usual abnormality quotient that Kashmir is accustomed to. It is frighteningly exceptional.

Govt to bolster J&K security over new threat

NEW DELHI, Aug. 5 -- The Union government has decided to scale up the presence of defence forces in Jammu and Kashmir to prepare for a possible threat arising from increased influence of the Pakistan-backed Taliban once US troops withdraw from Afghanistan, people aware of the developments said on Sunday.
The situation in Kashmir, and the ascendency of the Taliban and fellow jihadists in Kabul as a fallout of the future US withdrawal from Afghanistan, were among the issues discussed between the home minister, national security adviser Ajit Doval, home secretary Rajiv Gauba and additional secretary (Kashmir) Gyanesh Kumar at Parliament House on Sunday, top government officials said on condition of anonymity.
Thousands of tourists and Amarnath pilgrims left Kashmir over the weekend as the state administration cut short the annual pilgrimage by a fortnight and asked vacationers and pilgrims to leave the Valley because of a perceived terror threat. Security was reinforced with additional troops over the past week, leading to tensions in the state over the security build-up.
The Indian Army said on Saturday it repelled an attempt by a mixed group of Pakistani soldiers and terrorists to attack an army post along the Line of Control (LoC) in Keran sector, killing five to seven intruders.
With India anticipating the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government feels that the biggest impact of the rise of fundamentalist forces in Kabul will be on Kashmir, an official said.
National security planners have reviewed how Harkat-ulAnsar (parent of the Jaish-e-Mohammed) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) camps had shifted to Khost in eastern Afghanistan under the protection of the then Taliban regime. The Khost camp of the al Qaeda was bombed by US cruise missiles in August 1998 under directions of then President Bill Clinton.
The threat of terrorism in Kashmir could increase just as it did after the Taliban took control of Kabul in 1996, the official added. The rise of the Taliban in the past lead to terror attacks by jihadists in Jammu and Kashmir as well as the IC-814 hijacking by the Harkat-ul-Ansar.
"We expect the US to virtually leave Afghanistan to the Pakistan-supported Taliban through some power-sharing agreement... And this will happen very soon, with talks between the US and Taliban already on in Qatar," said another senior official. The fallout of the US withdrawal from Afghanistan will be a subject of discussion when Prime Minister Narendra Modi meets US President Donald Trump next month, the officials added.
Around 25,000 -30,000 troops have already been deployed in the state over the last week, according to people aware of the deployment.
While Indian security forces are prepared for the new challenge, the government is also thinking about what political steps can be taken in Jammu and Kashmir, including conducting state elections this winter, the officials said.
Local political parties have accused the administration of creating disquiet in Jammu and Kashmir. An all-party meeting was held on Sunday evening at the residence of National Conference (NC) chief Farooq Abdullah amid tensions over the deployment of additional troops.
The parties, including the National Conference and the Mehbooba Mufti-led Peoples Democratic Party, unanimously resolved to fight any attempt to abrogate the constitutional provisions that guarantee Jammu and Kashmir special status. The parties also appealed to India and Pakistan not to take any steps that will escalate tension in the region.

Srinagar, Aug. 5 -- The Indian Army on Sunday asked Pakistan to take back the bodies of their personnel who were killed in north Kashmir's Keran sector after security forces foiled an attack by a Border Action Team (BAT).
The Pakistan Army has been asked to approach the Indian Army while raising white flags and take possession of the bodies that are lying on the Indian side of the Line of Control, an official said.
The situation along the LoC has been tense, with the army saying that it foiled an operation by a Pakistani BAT, killing "5 to 7 Pak regulars/terrorists". Pakistan has denied its involvement in the attack that was launched on Saturday.
Defense spokesman Rajesh Kalia said that Indian Army had on Saturday asked its Pakistani counterpart to retrieve the bodies of their personnel in Keran Sector for last rites. "Pak Army yet to respond," he said in statement issued on Sunday.
On Saturday, the army said that an attempt to disturb peace by BAT was foiled by troops at the forward posts in Keran sector of Kupwara district resulting in "neutralising of 5 to 7 Pak regulars/terrorists". The army also said that it had repelled an attempt by a mixed group of Pakistani soldiers and terrorists to attack an army post along the LoC, inflicting heavy casualties. It said that "in the last 36 hours Pakistan has desperately tried to revive terrorism and push terrorists" into Kashmir.
In separate counter-terror operations, one suspected Hizbul Mujahideen and three Jaish-eMohammed militants have been killed in Shopian and Baramulla districts in the past three days.
The central government has deployed additional forces over the past couple of weeks in Kashmir. On Friday, Indian forces recovered a huge cache of arms, including a mine with a Pakistan Ordnance Factory stamp on it and an American sniper rifle, from one of the two routes leading to the famous cave shrine of Amarnath, during a three-day intensive search operation to sanitize the Amarnath yatra routes after intelligence inputs that Pakistani army would target the pilgrimage.

TROOPS' MOVEMENT, YATRA CANCELLATION: HOW THE TENSIONS UNFOLDED

New Delhi, Aug. 5 -- The Centre's move to send 100 companies of securitymen set off wild speculations in the Valley. The cancellation of Amarnath yatra in view of terror threats added fuel to the fire. Here's how events unfolded in Kashmir over the past few days.
July 27, Saturday:
News came in that an additional 100 companies of the Central Armed Police Forces will be deployed in Jammu and Kashmir for counter-insurgency operations and to maintain law and order. The Union home ministry wrote to the state chief secretary, home secretary and the director general of police to this effect late on Thursday. Of the 100 companies, 50 will be from the CRPF, 10 from the BSF, 30 from the Sashastra Seema
Bal (SSB) and 10 from the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), according to the letter.
July 28, Sunday:
The government move set off speculation in the Kashmir Valley. In a charged political atmosphere, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) president Mehbooba Mufti warned the Centre that any attempt to tinker with the special status of the state would blow up in its face. The state is currently under President's Rule. Over the past few days, every government order is being seen as a precursor to revoking Article 35A of the Constitution that gives special privileges to the state's domiciled residents. The revocation of Article 35A and Article 370 (the latter gives autonomous status to Jammu & Kashmir) is one of the promises listed in the Bharatiya Janata Party's manifesto for the April-May parliamentary elections.
July 29, Monday:
An order by the J&K Police seeking details on mosques and their management committees that went viral on social media gave an impetus to the buzz about the possibility of the Centre moving to revoke Article 35A. The order was issued on July 28 by SSP, Srinagar, Haseeb Mughal, who described it as "routine police activity."
July 30, Tuesday:
J&K governor Satya Pal Malik asked people not to pay heed to rumours of an impending decision on the special status of the state. Malik did not mention a Railway Police Officer's order on stockpiling rations but presumably referred to it when he said such orders were invalid. For their part, separatists in the Valley accused the Centre of deliberately vitiating the situation by issuing "daily orders".
July 31, Wednesday:
Former CM Mehbooba Mufti launched an awareness campaign regarding the Constitution's Article 35A. Mufti travelled to three districts of south Kashmir - Kulgam, Shopian and Pulwama - and held meetings with PDP activists to promote awareness about Article 35A. For his part, BJP general secretary Ram Madhav blamed mainstream political parties for spreading fear in the Valley. Addressing a conference in Srinagar, Ram Madhav said the BJP will take a decision which will be in the interest of the people. "The movement of personnel in Kashmir is a routine affair," he said.
August 1, Thursday:
A National Conference (NC) delegation led by party president Farooq Abdullah met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi and apprised him of the current situation in J&K. The NC chief reportedly told PM Modi that any move to revoke Article 35A could worsen the situation in the state. Separately, there were speculations that over 280 companies of security forces were in the process of being deployed in the Kashmir valley. The Union home ministry later denied the reports.
August 2, Friday:
The Amarnath yatra ended 14 days ahead of its scheduled close on August 15 and the counter-insurgency grid in J&K was strengthened following the recovery of a large cache of ammunition along the route of the yatra. Intelligence reports highlighted the possibility of suicide bombing attacks in the Valley. The cutting short of the yatra and an alert issued to pilgrims and tourists to return home, resulted in panic and a scramble for air tickets.
August 3, Saturday:
The army said it repelled an attempt by a mixed group of Pakistani soldiers and terrorists to attack an army post along the LoC, inflicting heavy casualties. Critically, the army said that "in the last 36 hours Pakistan has desperately tried to revive terrorism and push terrorists" into Kashmir. NC leader Omar Abdullah met governor Malik on Saturday and urged the central government to clear the air about what was going on in the Valley even as thousands of tourists and Amarnath worshippers left Kashmir. Around 1,400 non-local students from National Institute of Technology (NIT), Srinagar, left the
Valley in special buses arranged by the administration, after a notice came up on Friday evening saying that classes were being suspended till further orders.
August 4, Sunday:
Union home minister Amit Shah met senior officials in New Delhi as the security infrastructure informed the government that at least one attempt by terrorists to breach LoC was successful. Those who attended the meeting included the national security advisor Ajit Doval and Union home secretary Rajiv Gauba, among others. In Kashmir, an all-party meeting was held at the residence of Farooq Abdullah.

'Success in Jammu & Kashmir is our biggest achievement'

India, Aug. 5 -- Union minister of information & broadcasting and environment & forests Prakash Javadekar spoke to Smriti Kak Ramachandran and Jayashree Nandi on a range of issues, including environmental clearances, the forest act, and situation in Jammu and Kashmir, mob violence, and criticism from the Opposition that the government was pushing legislations through Parliament without enough discussion. Edited excerpts:
I think the government has made it very clear that there is a perceptible threat perception, and we don't want a terror attack; we want to foil it.
Therefore, the governor has made it very clear to not only the delegation of political leaders, but to the people, by giving interviews and holding a press conference that people should not worry, nothing is going to happen dramatically.
These are all precautionary measures. I think that suffices the purpose, nothing more should be added at this juncture.
The Kashmir success story is one of the most important achievements of the Modi government. We talk straight to the people, not to the separatists and that has resulted in holding of panchayat elections in 40,000-odd villages with 75% voting, and peacefully.
Premature deaths are a serious issue. It is not happening only in Delhi, but in non-polluted areas also.
Therefore, there is no direct correlation. But because of air pollution, there is a problem of pulmonary functions, lungs, throat infection. It definitely impacts these.
Therefore, we have taken major action. Don't you feel good in Delhi today? The good air days have increased, and bad days have reduced. A fair amount of this is a result of what we have done in the last five years.
People are aware; in polluted cities, they are demanding action - that's the strength of a democracy.
Things will fall in line. Now everybody has realised that we have to tackle pollution. Pollution mitigation has a cost, but we need to incur that cost. I have come up with a new idea of oxygen banks.
There is a study which shows seven fully grown trees give as much oxygen as one man requires throughout his life.
If that is the case, everyone should be committed for planting and ensuring the full growth of seven trees .
We want to change processes without compromising on environmental considerations.
We have installed 24x7 monitoring stations on chimneys and on water discharge points and more than 3,500 industrial units.
We want to make the process more rigorous but at the same time it can be made easy.
That is why the time lag [for environmental clearances] which was 680 days during Jairam Ramesh and Jayanthi Natarajan [former environment ministers] has come down to 108 days, and I want to bring it down to 70-80 days.
There is no amendment. Let me make it clear that we have not proposed a single amendment to the Indian Forest Act. It's a zero draft for discussion. Officers had drafted it. It's not a government-approved draft.
There is historical responsibility of developed countries which have reaped benefits out of industrial revolution. Now what we are saying is that we need a global solution to climate change.
Advanced countries have committed $100 billion for finance every year and technology transfer, but both are not happening. We will definitely put in our view in all forums available, in New York, in Chile, now when I go to Brazil. Major polluting countries are not part of the Paris deal. That's my worry.
The Motor Vehicles bill, for instance, has gone to the standing committee to the select committee. Why did the bill come to Parliament again;because of Congress's non-cooperation, because of the Oppositions' opposition for the sake of opposition, which led to a backlog.
These bills lapsed because of Parliament elections.
Actually the Opposition owes an apology to the people that it delayed the passage of bills that were duly scrutinised.
A majority of the bills that we are passing today have undergone scrutiny by the standing committee, many of them at the select committee also; but if you want to appoint yet another select committee, I think this is taking it too far. This is not rushing, this is what the legislature is meant for. The Legislature is meant for legislation, and that is what we are doing.
Michael Schumacher [former Formula One champion] used to say that small is beautiful. But we know in daily life, small is beautiful only if it grows fast, like a child. A party has to grow. We were just two in Parliament in 1984 and only about two crore [20 million] members across the country. Now, we have already 11 crore [110 million] members and the membership drive will fetch another 6-7 crore members.
As far as poaching is concerned, we don't believe in it. I am the environment minister, I act against poaching.
For a good Congress worker, what must he be feeling...I always feel his anguish at the completely inactive party for the last two-and-a-half months as if it is dead.
There is no president, they couldn't even appoint a temporary one.
As far as Jai Shri Ram is concerned, the name of Ram is there from Arunachal Pradesh to Kerala. It is the ethos and Indian culture. [By showing] objection to Ram... West Bengal has done the worst kind of thing. If you want to call the police in Delhi, you ring 100; if you want to call the police in West Bengal what will you do... chant Jai Shri Ram and it comes immediately. This is wrong.
As far as lynching is concerned, let me tell you unequivocally that any kind of mob violence is absolutely unacceptable. But law-and-order being the state subjects, the state has to take effective actions and we are following up with every state where the incidents happen. As you know, lynching is projected as targeted [against specific communities]; no, it is all pervasive...More importantly, we have to see things in context, not disproportionately highlight them as if everywhere lynching is happening.
Yes, even a single incident of lynching or mob violence is bad and wrong.
Third, about our leaders talking out of tune - that has reduced to a great extent. People have understood the importance of party's image being hurt by non serious utterances and now everybody follows the discipline.

NEW DELHI: The Indian Army successfully foiled a BAT (border action team) operation by the Pakistani army in Jammu & Kashmir's Keran sector this week, killing five to seven terrorists or Special Services Group (SSG) commandos.Cross-border raids by BATs are normally undertaken by a group of six to seven Pakistan army soldiers mixed with a few terrorists after systematic reconnaissance of vulnerable spots and studying the deployment and patrolling patterns of Indian troops along the 778-km long LoC.The raids are planned and conducted by the Pakistani forces to push terrorists across the LoC into the Indian side.Pakistan army's elite Special Services Group (SSG) commandos are often part of the BAT actions.
The SSG commandos, or the 'black storks' as they are called due to their uniform colour, were among the first batches of intruders that crossed the LoC into Kargil in 1999 to establish fortified positions.In May 2017, two Indian soldiers were beheaded in Krishna Ghati sector in Poonch district during a BAT attack carried out under the cover of shelling by the Pakistani troops. The mutilation was roundly criticised as barbaric and led to escalation of military tension along the border.In January 2013, Lance Naik Hemraj was killed and his body mutilated by a BAT. It also beheaded Lance Naik Sudhakar Singh. Constable Rajinder Singh of the BSF battalion suffered injuries in the attack.Over the last two years, Pakistan army has attempted over half a dozen BAT raids to push intruders into the Indian side of Jammu & Kashmir and attack forward posts.

Jammu and Kashmir governor Satya Pal Malik on Tuesday asked people not to pay any heed to rumours of an impending major decision on the special status of the state.
The governor's comment came after political parties in the state accused the administration of creating disquiet and demanded that the Centre clear the air.
There has been a buzz in the state's political circles that the revocation of Article 35A that gives special privileges to permanent residents of the state is imminent.

Forces Deployment A Security Measure,No Knowledge Of Change In Constitutional Provisions:Guv

SRINAGAR, Aug. 4 -- Jammu and Kashmir Governor Satya Pal Malik on Saturday conveyed to a National Conference delegation that the state has no knowledge of any changes in the Constitutional provisions and assured that the deployment of additional paramilitary forces was purely for security reasons.
A statement released by the Raj Bhavan here said that the governor informed the delegation, led by former chief minister Omar Abdullah, that the security situation has developed in a manner which required immediate action.
"There were credible inputs which were available to the security agencies regarding terrorist attacks on the Amarnath Yatra. There has been intensified shelling on the LoC by Pakistan which was responded to effectively by the Army," the governor told the delegation.
He said that a press conference was addressed by the Army and the state police in which they briefed the media about how they foiled terror groups' sinister plans and also displayed weapons and ammunition they seized.
"The seriousness of the threat required immediate action," the governor said.
Malik also said that the state "has no knowledge of any changes to constitutional provisions" and hence no panic should be created by unnecessarily linking this security matters with all kinds of other issues.
"A pure security measure is being mixed up with issues with which it has no connection. That is the cause of the panic," he told the delegation.
It is in this security context that the government had issued an advisory Friday asking Yatris and tourists to return as soon as possible, he said.
"These are a vulnerable group of people who do not know the area and are extremely vulnerable to a terrorist or a fidayeen attack. It is the responsibility of the state to provide security to all its citizens. Therefore, as a precautionary measure, Yatris and tourists have been asked to return. This is to ensure that no terrorist attack takes place on them," the governor said.
The delegation led by Abdullah apprised the Governor about the situation in the Kashmir valley after the government advisory asking Amarnath Yatris and tourists to return as soon as possible.
They also mentioned about the panic created by people buying essential commodities hurriedly.
The governor again said that the security to its citizens has to be provided by the state even at some inconvenience, which is being done.
The governor requested the political leaders to ask their supporters to maintain calm and not believe exaggerated and unfounded rumours being circulated all around.

Indian army offers to return bodies of Pakistanis killed in Jammu and Kashmir's Keran area

India, Aug. 4 -- The Indian army has offered to return bodies of a Pakistani commando and terrorist killed in a firefight in Jammu and Kashmir's Keran sector last week.
Indian army sources said the Pakistani army has been asked to approach with a white flag and take over the bodies for last rites. The Pakistani Army is yet to respond.
The two were among four killed when a group of Pakistani soldiers and terrorists attacked an army border post along the Line of Control (LoC) in Keran sector. The commando is said to be a member of Pakistan's Special Service Group.
The army suspects the attackers were part of Pakistan's Border Action Team, or BAT which has in the past carried out hit jobs near the border before returning to Pakistan, sometimes under the cover of firing from Pakistani posts.
Saturday's disclosure by the army about the attack on the border post came on the heels of the government aborting the Amarnath pilgrimage in Kashmir over security threats. On Friday, the government asked pilgrims and tourists to leave the valley at the earliest.
'Pakistan based terrorists plotting attack on Amarnath yatra': Army
The central government has deployed additional forces over the past couple of weeks in Kashmir.
On Friday, Indian forces recovered mine with a Pakistani ordnance factory marking from one of the two routes leading to the famous cave shrine of Amarnath.
Indian forces had also seized an including an American sniper rifle and IEDs during a three-day intensive search operation to sanitize the Amarnath yatra routes after intelligence inputs that Pakistani army would target the pilgrimage.

Specific terror threats led to decision on calling off Amarnath Yatra

India, Aug. 4 -- Specific threats to both the northern and southern routes leading to the holy Amarnath cave forced the hand of the administration in calling off the Amarnath Yatra two weeks ahead of the scheduled close of the pilgrimage on August 15, Hindustan Time has learnt.
According to top security officials based in New Delhi and Kashmir, an anti-personnel landmine manufactured by a Pakistani ordnance factory and a sniper rifle with a 1.5 kilometer kill range were recovered from Sangam top, just 3 kilometres short of the cave, by a 3 Sector Rashtriya Rifles unit deployed on the northern axis.
An improvised explosive device was recovered by a 1 sector Rashtriya Rifles unit, 1.5 kilometres north-east of Sheshnag, around 14 kilometres from the holy cave, on the southern route. The yatra was called off on Friday after the recoveries in the last week of July because it had become evident that Pakistani jihadists were out to target the pilgrims.
Under Operation Shiva, the security forces, on the basis of actionable intelligence inputs that indicated the targeting of civilians by the Jaish-e-Mohammed(JeM) terror group, put in place enhanced measures to neutralise the opportunities available to the jihadists to target the yatris.

The roads to Chandanwari and Baltal, the starting points of the two routes to the cave, were covered by road opening parties of paramilitary forces, whose search and anti-sabotage teams were pressed into service. The Indian army's Victor Force units searched parallel areas.
Preliminary reports suggest that the US-made M24 sniper rifle may have been procured from the Taliban by the JeM, a fellow Deobandi proponent, after the weapon was looted from the Afghan army. With the weapon having a range of 1.5 kilometres, the pilgrims would have been sitting ducks for the sniper, who would have been positioned around Sangam top.
With JeM seeking to avenge the February 26 Indian air force strikes on its camp in Pakistan's Balakot camp, in which an unspecified number of its recruits were believed to have died, there has been a continuous flow of intelligence about the regrouping of the Pakistan-based group to attack Indian security forces in Kashmir.
Intelligence reports indicated that JeM cadre were planning an improvised explosive device (IED) attack on a security forces convoy on the Srinagar-Baramulla-Uri national highway on the lines of the February 14 Pulwama suicide car bombing that killed 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) troopers. Material for the IED's fabrication, as per the reports, had already reached the Valley.
Another input highlighted the presence of a batch of three JeM terrorists in the Nezapir area of Poonch who could be used to plant IEDs on tracks used by Indian troops deployed in the posts of Barood, Sher, Shakti and Kaiyaan.
It is quite evident from the intelligence reports, whose contents were disclosed to Hindustan Times by security officials, that Pakistan had taken no action to restrain JeM. Fifteen Jihadists were moved to JeM camps in Markaz, Sanam bin Salma and Tarnab farms in Peshawar in Khyber Paktunkhwa (KPK) province after completing training in "askari jihad" at camps in the Jamrud area. Four of these 15 are from Nowhar and Peshawar, four from the Ali Masjid area en-route to Landi Kotal,located on the route across the mountains to Peshawar, and the remaining from Khyber province.
Given the serious threat posed by JeM to the Amarnath Yatra and the Kashmir valley as a whole, the Narendra Modi government decided to call off the pilgrimage rather than risk the lives of the pilgrims. On July 23-24, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval conducted an on-ground threat assessment in the Valley and briefed the three service chiefs and intelligence chiefs the same week on the need to reinforce security in the Valley to meet the terror threat.

SRINAGAR/NEW DELHI, Aug. 4 -- Thousands of tourists and Amarnath worshippers left Kashmir on Saturday as security was reinforced across the Valley by additional troops, a day after the state administration cut short the annual pilgrimage to the Himalayan cave shrine by a fortnight and asked vacationers and pilgrims to leave the Valley because of a perceived terrorist threat.
The army, meanwhile, said it had repelled an attempt by a mixed group of Pakistani soldiers and terrorists to attack an army post along the LoC, inflicting heavy casualties. Critically, the army said that "in the last 36 hours Pakistan has desperately tried to revive terrorism and push terrorists" into Kashmir. Separately, in joint counter-terror operations in the hinterland, the army, Central Reserve Police Force, and Jammu and Kashmir police killed one suspected Hizbul Mujahideen and three Jaish-e-Mohammed militants in Shopian and Baramulla districts in the last two days.
Around 95% of the estimated 20,000 tourists, both Indian and foreign, and pilgrims who were in Kashmir late Friday had already left by late Saturday, on board heavy-lift IAF aircraft that first dropped off security reinforcements, on commercial flights run by airlines that steeply raised fares and by state transport corporation buses, tourism department officials said. Around 25,000 -30,000 troops have already been deployed in the state over the last four-five days, police officers aware of the deployment said.
Amid panic buying of groceries, fuel and medicines by local residents unsure about what to expect, political parties accused the administration of creating disquiet and demanded that the central government clear the air on what's happening in Valley.

Srinagar, Aug. 4 -- Three militants were killed in two separate encounters in Kashmir on Saturday.
Earlier on Friday, a Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) militant and an army man were killed in south Kashmir's Shopian district where a gun fight between militants and security forces erupted while police personnel were conducting searches in Pandushan village.
The gunfight continued on Saturday and a joint party of the police, army and CRPF managed to kill another militant. "Another terrorist, identified as Manzoor Ahmad Bhat of Wachi, has been killed," said police spokesperson, Manoj Kumar. "Bhat was associated to proscribed outfit Hizbul Mujahideen(HM) while Naikoo was affiliated to JeM. Both were wanted for their complicity in terror crimes, including attack on security establishments and civilians."On Friday, security forces recovered the body of Zeenat ul Islam Naikoo, a resident of Memandar Shopian. "Naikoo was one of the most prominent JeM militants in Shopian. He was wanted on a number off charges, including killing a cop, firing and grenade lobbing on a police station in Shopian and Gagren Camp. He was the key accused in FIR No 281/2018 of PS Shopian, in which four policemen lost their lives," Kumar said.A soldier was also fatally injured in the operation. "During the initial exchange of fire, one army jawan, identified as sepoy Rambir Singh of 34 Rashtriya Rifles sustained gunshot wounds. He was evacuated and sent to a hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries," Kumar said.In another encounter, in north Kashmir's Sopore in Baramulla district on Saturday, security forces killed two JeM militants after a search operation was launched jointly by the police, army and CRPF in Malamapanpora Warpora area of Sopore.One of the men was Umer Shahbaz Wani of Kharpora Bandipora and the other is an unidentified foreign terrorist. Army spokesperson Colonel Rajesh Kalia said, "In the last 36 hours no attempts have been made by Pakistan to disturb peace in valley and target the Amarnath Yatra. A BAT attempt was made at one of the forward posts in Keran sect, which was foiled by the troops. On Tuesday, security forces killed two militants, including a top JeM commander, Fayaz Panzoo, who according to the police was responsible for the killing of an Anantnag station house officer and five CRPF personnel in south Kashmir in June.
This year, the security forces have killed 135 militants so far. However, 76 security force personnel have also been killed, including the 40 CRPF jawans, killed in Pulwama.

AMRITSAR, Aug. 4 -- Celebrations of the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism, have given the peaceniks in India and Pakistan the border a reason to hope for an improvement in the relations between the two neighbours which have been at loggerheads in the recent past.
The Pulwama terror attack that left dead 44 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) troops in Jammu and Kashmir in February this year had worsened the bilateral ties between the two neighbours.
It was followed by the airstrikes carried out by the Indian Air Force (IAF) in Balakot (Pakistan) to target to terror camp.
The terror attack had raised doubts about the corridor project to provide Indian Sikhs an easy access to Gurdwara Darbar Sahib, Kartarpur, the last resting place of the Guru.
But as it draws near, the 550th Parkash Gurpurb seems to bring people of both the countries closer. The nagar kirtan from Nankana Sahib in Pakistan that arrived at the Attari-Wagah border on Thursday is a testimony of this.
A group of 500 Sikh devotees had gone to Pakistan to participate in the procession which was taken out with the cooperation of Pakistan authorities.
"The interest shown by the governments of the two countries is praiseworthy. We hope such cooperation will continue in future as well. The Kartarpur corridor project and other trans-border religious activities like nagar kirtans will strengthen love, brotherhood and harmony between both the countries," said Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee president Gobind Singh Longowal after he returned with the nagar kirtan.
Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal, who had earlier taken the stance of the BJP targeting cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu for hugging Pakistan army chief, wrote on social media after taking part in the procession at Attari, "Today is a sacred day and I am lucky that I was blessed to have darshan of first nagar kirtan that arrived from Nankana Sahib. I pray that this nagar kirtan brings permanent association between both the countries."
Indo-Pak peace activist and Hind-Pak Dosti Manch general secretary Satnam Singh Manak said, "The 550th Parkash Gurpurb is an opportunity to normalise the relations between the two nations. A true tribute to Guru Nanak will to shun enmity and hate as he preached brotherhood and harmony".
Folklore Research Academy, Amritsar, president Ramesh Yadav said, "We have dedicated our yearly magazine on Indo-Pak ties to the 550th birth anniversary."
The academy along with Hind-Pak Dosti Manch and Punjab Jagriti Manch organises Hind-Pak Dosti Mela every year on the eve of August 15.
Pakistan historian Shahid Shabir said, "People of Pakistan's Punjab also want peace between and the anniversary is the best occasion to do it."

Agra: Ramveer Beniwal, 25, from Mathura’s Hulwana Piparwala village was killed during an exchange of fire between terrorists and security forces in Jammu and Kashmir’s Shopian district on Friday.Ramveer was part of 34 Rashtriya Rifles Battalion (Jat) and was deployed at Shopian district when the area was attacked by terrorists late on Thursday. According to reports, security forces have cordoned off the affected area in Shopian and the encounter was still underway.Senior divisional magistrate, Chhatta, Dr Nitin Gaur, who visited the village, said that he had spoken to Company Commander Lt Col Mohan from Jat regiment and was informed that mortal remains of martyred soldier, Ramveer, will be brought to his native village from Agra airport on Saturday.“Local residents have demanded that a particular piece of land should be allotted for construction of a memorial in Ramveer’s memory.
After finalising the land, the proposal will be sent to the higher authorities for approval,” he said, adding that all the necessary arrangements will be made for the soldier’s last rites.According to Ramveer’s cousin brother Anoop Chaudhary, they heard the news at 6:30 in the morning. Chaudhary said that the officials from J&K told them that Ramveer was grievously injured during an exchange of fire. He took three bullets on his chest and was immediately taken to a hospital but could not be saved despite the doctors’ best efforts.Chaudhary told TOI that Ramveer had returned to Jammu on March 29 after being on a two-month vacation with his family. “We never thought that this would be his last visit to the village,” said Chaudhary, adding that now only his body will come here.Ramveer’s devastated wife Neetu told TOI, “What will happen to my little children’s future. They aren’t even aware of their father’s demise?”She said that her younger son, Aditya is six-month-old and elder one, Shiva is three. Shiva has just started going to school. “Life has come to a standstill for me as I am a housewife and I have never worked outside the confines of my home,” she said, adding that her husband last spoke to her on Wednesday evening.Ramveer’s another cousin brother Mahesh Beniwal said that “there should be revenge against the killings of our brave soldiers”. “My four brothers are in the Army and we want to take revenge against the killings of our brave soldiers,” said Mahesh, wondering how long “we have to suffer this senseless violence”.

Attack on J-K border post foiled, 4 including Pak commandos killed: Army

India, Aug. 3 -- An infiltration bid by a mixed group of Pakistani soldiers and terrorists, who tried to attack an Indian Army Post in the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu Kashmir's Keran sector this week, was foiled by the security forces, said the Indian Army on Saturday.
The Indian Army said the attack on the post was carried out by Pakistan's Border Action Team (BAT) at Keran sector on the intervening night of July 31 and August 1. Keran Sector is opposite the lower Neelam valley and is a traditional infiltration route because of the terrain and weather.
"Our soldiers foiled the attempt inflicting heavy casualties on the infiltrating team," the Indian Army said and added "four bodies of Pakistan SSG commandos (Special forces) or maybe some of the terrorists have been seen close" to the Indian army post. Bodies of the infiltrators haven't been recovered. Attempts to recover the bodies are being continuously interfered by Pakistani troops deployed across the LoC," the Indian Army said.
Separately in counter-terror operations in the hinterland, the security forces - Central Reserve Police Force, Indian Army, and J&K Police - have killed three suspected JeM terrorist in Kashmir's Kulgam, Shopiyan, and Bandipora respectively in the last 36 hours.
"In the last 36 hours Pakistan has desperately tried to revive terrorism and push terrorists into Kashmir, " said the Army.
On Friday, the Jammu and Kashmir Government ordered Amarnath Yatra pilgrims to return post-haste. And, earlier in the day yesterday, the Army and J&K Police in a joint press conference claimed to have recovered a sophisticated sniper rifle and a Pak ordnance mark bearing anti-personnel mine from the route taken by devotees to the Amarnath shrine. In addition, Indian security agencies have picked up chatter to suggest terrorist especially of the Jaish-e -Mohammed(JeM) were being activated across the border to cross over to India.
In a related development, the Indian Army strongly denied using cluster bombs in cross border firing - an allegation made by Islamabad. In a sharp response, the Indian Army described the claims of Pakistan army as "lies deceit and deception."
Cluster bombs eject explosive bomblets that are designed to kill personnel and destroy vehicles.
The Indian Army Spokesperson said, "the Pakistan army regularly attempts to push terrorists through infiltration and opens fire with a multitude of weapons to assist them (infiltrators)." It also said, "India during numerous Directorate of Military Operations (DGMO) level talks have maintained the right to respond. Such responses are only against military targets and infiltrating terrorists who are aided by the Pakistan army."
Earlier, Pakistan's foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi and the spokesman for Pakistan's armed forces as well as Pakistan's People's Party leader Bilawal Bhutto slammed India for what they described as atrocities against Kashmiri civilians.
The Director-General of Inter-Services Public Relations - the media wing of the Pakistan armed forces - said in a tweet, "Use of cluster bombs by Indian Army violating international conventions is condemnable. No weapon can suppress determination of Kashmiris to get their right of self-determination. Kashmir runs in the blood of every Pakistani. Indigenous freedom struggle of Kashmiris shall succeed." Similarly, Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi tweeted saying, "strongly condemn the blatant use of cluster ammunition by Indian Security Forces targeting innocent civilians along the Line of Control." Both Pakistan Army and Qureshi posted pictures including those of children allegedly injured in the attack. But, neither of the pictures were dated making it almost impossible to ascertain their veracity.
India has accused Pakistan of fomenting terrorism in Kashmir, a charge that Islamabad denies, though it admits to extending moral, political and diplomatic support to what it describes as a freedom struggle in Kashmir.

India, Aug. 3 -- Two Jaish-e-Mohammed militants have been eliminated in an encounter in south Kashmir, kilometres away from the spot where four policemen were shot dead in an attack anchored by him. The encounter in Shopian's Pandushan has been on for more than 24 hours.
A security official said Zeenat ul Islam Naikoo had been neutralised. The second militant is yet to be identified. The successful operation, however, came at a heavy cost. A soldier, Sepoy Rambir Singh of 34 Rashtriya Rifles, made the supreme sacrifice.
Zeenat Naikoo is being described as the most important local militant of Jaish-e -Mohammad in Shopian, the terror group that has been prepping to scale up activities in Kashmir valley over the last few weeks. Zeenat Naikoo played the role of local anchor to the Jaish foreign terrorists who crossed over from Pakistan.
Intelligence reports indicate that Jaish chief Masood Azhar's brother, Ibrahim Azhar intends to come to the Kashmir valley to lead attacks on targets in the valley to avenge the death of his son. Ibrahim Azhar is reported to have attempted to fire up the cadre, telling them that he wanted to die fighting Indian security forces in Kashmir, the same way his son had.
He played the role of local anchor to the Jaish FTs. He was involved in various incidents of violence including cop killing and firing and grenade lobbing on PS SHOPIAN and Gagren Camp.
A senior official said Zeenat Naikoo played a key role in the deadly attack on policemen escorting a deputy superintendent of police in Shopian last August. The attack was carried out hours after security forces killed a top commander of Hizbul Mujahedeen Altaf Ahmad Dar
"He was part of groups involved in planning and executing series of terror attacks in the area and many other civilian atrocities. Zeenat has a long history of terror crime records and several terror crime cases were registered against him," a Jammu and Kashmir police spokesman said.
Just as security forces were wrapping up this encounter, another one started about 100 km away in north Kashmir's Sopore area of Baramulla. Officials said army and police launched the operation after forces received an input that some operatives were hiding in Warpora village. An army jawan who hailed from this village was shot dead when he went home on leave in April this year.

Addressing a joint presser at 15 Corps headquarters here, GoC KJS Dhillon said IED threats and activities are on increase over the last one year.
"There were different attempts of IED attacks, after Pulwama, militants used IED in Banihal attack another in June on Army vehicle in Arihal Pulwama and on 26th of July again in Arihal. Today morning, they again planted an IED and damaged our vehicle in Pulwama," he said.
He said the threat of IED was more pronounced and they have killed most of the militants who were IED experts including the Munna Lohari, who was killed in an encounter last week.
"Apart from Munna Lahori, Similarly Fayaaz Panzoo who was also involved in few IED blasts, was also eliminated in an encounter last week," he said.
The army commander said Pakistan and its Army was desperate to disrupt peace in Kashmir, and "this will not be allowed to happen."
"Type of IEDs we are examining and the IED expert (militants) we are capturing and eliminating point to the fact that Pakistan is trying to disrupt peace in Kashmir. We assure the (people) of Kashmir that no one will be allowed to disrupt peace," he said.The army commander who was flanked by DGP Dilbagh Singh, IGP Kashmir S P and ADG CRPF, Zulfiqar Hassaan, said that a US made sniper and the landmine was recovered enroot the cave shrine after extensive searches for the last three days.
They said that there are serious inputs that militants may target the Amarnath Yatra but forces are on alert mode to thwart all such designs. He said the land mine has a manufacturing number of Pakistani company.
"Based on inputs, a throw search operating was launched in Pahalgam and Baltal site, a cache of ammunition was recovered along these roots."
DGP Dilbag Singh said Al Badr militant outfit is almost decimated and Hizb-ul-Mujahideen has been "demolished to a large extent."
"Overall number of active militants in the Valley has come down and the number of active militants in Jammu region is also ended with the surrender of one militant, couple of days in Kishtawar," he said, adding, "Our second target was the (militant) support network because of which the militancy rises and survives in the state. So therefore a strong action was targeted against the OGWs and a very large of OGWs were arrested, detained." Apart from them, he said: "we have also taken care of the organizations which were resorting to unlawful activities like Jamaat-i-Islaami, JKLF and their activists and leaders were also booked under various sections of law."
Speaking on the IED module, IGP Kashmir S P said that most of the Pakistani militants have created this type of module and tried to use explosives for attacks.
"This year more than 10 serious attempts were made in different parts of the valley, primary in South Kashmir's Pulwama and Shopian district and the trend has shifted to other places," Pani said, adding "Many people have been arrested".
"Some of the kingpins involved in the making of IEDs like Munna Lahori, Usman, and Kamran all these Pakistanis were responsible have also been killed,"
Speaking in the press conference, ADG CRPF Zulfikar Hassan, IED is increasing in both numbers and methodology, "it's a serious threat, however we are up to it and will handle it successfully," he said.
Dhillon refused to give the exact location from where the recovery was made as the search operation was still going on.
He said the threat of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in Jammu and Kashmir is more "pronounced" in the hinterland even as the situation along the Line of Control (LoC) remains "largely peaceful".
"Regular infiltration attempts are being made by Pakistan-based militants but the Army is thwarting their bids at the LoC," he said.
On the reports of additional troops being sent to the Valley, Jammu and Kashmir DGP Dilbag Singh said security personnel were on regular duty during the year because of elections, among others, with no time to relax.
He said there were also "fresh inputs of increase in violence by militants" which made it necessary to "strengthen the counter intelligence grid" on the ground.
Refusing to give the exact number of additional troops being sent to the Valley, Singh said they will give on-ground troops some time to relax and strengthen the security system.

Decoded: Why the government decided to curtail the Amarnath yatra

India, Aug. 3 -- The government decided to end the Amarnath yatra and strengthen the counter-insurgency grid in Kashmir by fresh induction of forces after Indian intelligence reports indicated the possibility of multiple suicide attacks in the Valley and targeting of security forces by improvised explosive device (IED) in Sopore area by Pakistan-based terrorist groups, particularly the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) group, two persons familiar with the development said.
According to one set of inputs that reached the national security establishment, Ibrahim Azhar, elder brother of JeM chief Masood Azhar, was sighted in Muzaffarabad in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) last month.
'Pakistan based terrorists plotting attack on Amarnath yatra': Army
Intelligence reports indicate that Ibrahim Azhar, the main orchestrator of the IC-814 hijacking in 1999, wanted to infiltrate into the Valley and lead attacks against Indian establishment to avenge the death of his son, Usman Haider, in a security operation in Jammu and Kashmir.
Inputs also indicated that trained JeM cadre had also formed Border Action Teams under the leadership of Ibrahim Azhar and moved to forward Pakistan army posts across the Line of Control (LoC) action.

Ibrahim Azhar's son had infiltrated into Jammu and Kashmir in October 2018 and was gunned down by the Indian security forces in Awantipora area of Pulwama on October 30, 2018.
Another relative Talha Rasheed, son of Abdul Rasheed, brother-in-law of Masood Azhar, was killed on November 6, 2017 at Kandi Aglar, Pulwama by security forces.
Intelligence intercepts indicate that Ibrahim Azhar had fired up the Jaish cadre, telling them that he wanted to die fighting Indian security forces in Kashmir, the same way his son had died.
A senior security official said intelligence inputs around the Ibrahim Azhar's groundwork to lead the terror attacks from the ground in Kashmir played a crucial role in the government's decision.

Already, the Indian intelligence establishment had noticed heightened activities of Pakistan-based terror groups including JeM and Lashkar-e-Tayyeba (LeT).
"With major threat coming from Pakistan based groups particularly JeM and recovery of M 24 sniper rifle and anti-personnel mines along the Amarnath pilgrimage route, the government decided not to take chances and curtailed the yatra. With personnel freed from yatra duties, the security forces can now concentrate on counter-insurgency grid," said a senior JK Police offer.
Intelligence reports detail how the Pak-based groups were in the process of aggressively planning series of infiltration of armed cadre to step up violence in Kashmir. This included suicide attacks at multiple locations in Kashmir Valley.
Intelligence reports also spoke of JeM targeting the Indian security forces by IED in Sopore area of north Kashmir. Trained JeM cadre, an official said, are being readied in Peshawar to infiltrate into Kashmir and engage the Indian security forces through spectacular attacks.
Other terror groups like Hizbul Mujahideen, according to intelligence reports, were asked to coordinate with Pakistan based terror groups for IED attacks in South Kashmir and Srinagar.

J&K on edge, Amarnath yatra called off due to terror threat

Govt Seeks To Soothe Fears Amid Troop Deployment
The Amarnath yatra was called off almost two weeks ahead of schedule with security forces uncovering what they said was an imminent attack, leading to the Jammu and Kashmir administration asking tourists and yatris to leave the state as soon as possible in view of the prevailing situation.
The decision sparked uncertainty in J&K, which is already on the edge in view of reinforcements of troops being sent to the valley over the past few days. While 28,000 paramilitary personnel were inducted in the valley over the past week, around 32,500 troops will be disengaged from yatra duties and moved to Kashmir. There are already 35,000 troops stationed in the valley and their number will rise to almost 90,000 now: an augmentation which many are seeing through the prism of BJP's poll commitment to abrogate Article 35A.
In Srinagar, Lt General K J S Dhillion, in-charge of the Chinar Corps, said a mine with Pakistan ordnance factory markings was found during search operations along the yatra route. A cache of arms seized included a US M-24 sniper rifle, he said."Pakistan and Pakistani army are desperate to vitiate the atmosphere here in Kashmir, which is evident from specific and confirmed intelligence inputs that terrorists are planning attacks on Amarnath yatris and tourists," Gen Dhillion said.
The announcement failed to quell speculation about the Centre's plan vis-a-vis Article 35A, which gives the J&K legislature full discretionary power to decide who are 'permanent residents' of the state.
Article 35A gives them special rights and privileges regarding employment with the state government, acquisition of property in the state, settling in the state, and the right to scholarships and other forms of aid that the state government provides. The government on Friday tried to play down the inductions saying around 100 companies received orders around a week ago and are in the process of reaching their destinations."Based on the assessment of internal security situation, training requirements, the need for paramilitary troops to be rotated for rest and recuperation, induction and de-induction of central forces is a continuous and dynamic process," said an official.
Sources in the security establishment, while not speculating on reasons for fresh troop deployment and discontinuation of the yatra, said there were inputs of a major threat, including use of IEDs, against pilgrims and tourists in the valley.
Around 5-6 foreign terrorists were believed to have infiltrated into J&K some four-five days ago, possibly explaining recent ceasefire violations on Pakistan border. It is understood that the infiltrators formed teams with terrorists holed up in the Valley, with instructions to fan out across south Kashmir to carry out attacks on yatris and tourists.
A CRPF official said the inputs led to forces suspending the yatra to sanitise the route, during which several recoveries mentioned by Gen Dhillon were made. The sanitising operations were continuing till late on Friday. The threat of possible attacks is seen as serious and immediate and though numbers of incoming yatris to Amarnath were already thinning after hitting a high of 3.40 lakh 'darshans', a considered decision was taken to end the yatra nearly a fortnight in advance.

JAMMU, Aug. 3 -- Head priest of the ancient Ram Temple, Mahant Rameshwar Dass on Friday said the annual Amarnath pilgrimage has faced many challenges in the past but it was never curtailed. He, however, said the state government advisory maybe a precursor to some good news for the state.
"The pilgrimage has faced many challenges, including terror attacks and adverse weather conditions, in the past many decades, but despite the challenges, the yatra was never curtailed," he told HT. The head priest further said that the order may shortly bring a positive outcome.
The speculation dominating the discourse in Kashmir over the past few days, is that the Centre may have plans to do away with Article 35A of the Constitution.
"In my view, we are going to hear some heartening news with respect to Jammu and Kashmir and the nation as a whole," said the mahant.
Mainstream political parties such as the National Conference (NC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have vowed to resist any move to tinker with the special status to the state.
On Thursday, a delegation comprising NC chief Farooq Abdullah, former CM Omar Abdullah and a party MP Hasnain Masoodi met prime minister Narendra Modi and urged him not to take any step which may lead to deterioration in the law and order situation in the state.

Shah, Digvijaya cross swords in RS over UAPA

Jammu, Aug. 2 -- During a discussion today on the anti-terror Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Amendment Bill (UAPA) that has been cleared by both Houses of Parliament, an acrid exchange took place between Home Minister Amit Shah and Congress leader Digvijaya Singh.
The Bill, passed by the Lok Sabha last week, seeks to empower central government to designate individuals suspected to have terror links as terrorists. Till now, the government could only designate organisations, not individuals, as terrorists.
As Digvijaya Singh, along with party colleague P Chidambaram, argued against the bill in the Rajya Sabha, warning against its misuse by government agencies, Amit Shah retorted: "What happened during emergency? All media was banned, all opposition leaders were jailed. There was no democracy for 19 months, and you are accusing us of misusing laws? Kindly look at your past."
The Home Minister also took a dig at former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Digvijaya Singh and remarked that he was angry because he had lost the election. Digvijaya Singh, who lost the national election from Bhopal to the BJP's Pragya Thakur -- an accused in the 2008 Malegaon blasts - had accused the ruling party of fielding a terror-accused. "The BJP president (Shah) makes them candidates even as they are still facing charges of terrorism," he said.
"Digvijaya Singh ji seems angry, it is natural, he just lost elections... he said in three cases of NIA (National Investigation Agency) no one was punished. I will tell you why, because earlier in these cases, there was political vendetta and an attempt was made to link a particular religion to terror," said Shah. He also reminded that the BJP backed UAPA amendments when it was in the opposition as well.
"When we were in opposition, we supported previous UAPA amendments, be it in 2004, 2008 or 2013 as we believe all should support tough measures against terror. We also believe that terror has no religion, it is against humanity, not against a particular government or individual," the Home Minister said.
Digvijaya Singh had also accused the BJP of compromising national security. "We doubt their (BJP's) intent. Congress never compromised on terrorism that is why we had brought this law. It is you who compromised on terror, once during the release of Rubaiya Saeed ji and second by letting off Masood Azhar. We lost Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi and Beant Singh. But, we never compromised on terrorism," he said.

RS passes UAPA Bill

© 2019. Kashmir Times
Jammu, Aug. 2 -- The UAPA Amendment Bill or anti-terror bill was passed in the Rajya Sabha today. This Bill amends the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) (UAPA) Act, 1967. The UAPA Amendment Bill allows the government to tag individuals as terrorists if they commit or participate in the acts of terrorism, prepare for acts of terror, promote terrorism or are otherwise involved in terrorism. Earlier, the government was only empowered to designate organisations, and not individuals, as terrorists.
The new provisions also empower the Director-General, National Investigation Agency (NIA) to grant approval of seizure or attachment of property when the case is investigated by the agency. The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Activities (UAPA) Amendment Bill gives authority to the NIA officers, of the rank of Inspector or above to investigate cases.
The Lok Sabha has already passed the amendments to the UAPA Bill on July 24. In the Rajya Sabha, 147 members voted for the legislation while 42 members dissented it. The Congress and several other opposition parties opposed the provision of designating an individual as a terrorist and urged the government to refer the Bill to the Select Committee for further scrutiny. Replying to the same, Home Minister Amit Shah said a four-level scrutiny has been provided in the amendment and no human rights will be violated.
Shah said declaring individuals as terrorists is required as they float different organisations once an institution is banned. Global terrorists Masood Azhar and Hafiz Saeed will be the first two to be banned as individuals in India after the UAPA amendments are notified by the government. While Hafiz Saeed was the brains behind the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, Masood Azhar was responsible for the recent Pulwama attack as well as the 2001 attack on parliament.

'Stone pelters today, terrorists tomorrow': Army's grim message to J-K

Srinagar, Aug. 2 -- In a chilling note of caution to parents, especially mothers of youth in Jammu and Kashmir, Indian army said that 83% of all youth who become militants start with throwing stones for Rs 500 and therefore needed to be stopped.
This statistic, presented in a joint press conference of security forces operating in the militancy hit state of Jammu and Kashmir also adds to the political debate calling for leniency to stone throwers in the valley.
15 Corps Commander, Lieutenant General Dhillon went on to provide even more chilling statistics for the parents of "the misguided youth" to consider; "Majority of all youth taking up guns are eliminated within the first year of operation," he said. He encouraged the "boys who had gone astray" to lay down arms and return to mainstream since according to him, "the shelf-life of a terrorist who picks up a weapon was very short."
"7 per cent of militants who pick up guns are eliminated in the very first week, 9 per cent are killed in the first month, 36 per cent in the first 6 months and 64 per cent in first one year." Lieutenant General Dhillon said.
The number of stone-pelting incidents in the Kashmir valley has dipped under direct federal rule compared to the two previous political administrations - the Peoples Democratic Party-Bharatiya Janata Party (PDP-BJP) coalition that was in power between 2015 and mid-2018, and the National Conference-Indian National Congress (NC-INC) alliance that stayed in office between 2009 and 2014. The state is currently under President's rule.
A total of 349 stone-pelting cases were registered last year after the imposition of Governor's rule while 355 incidents had been recorded till July 17 in 2019.
According to data reviewed by Hindustan Times, the total number of stone-pelting cases registered under the NC-INC regime between 2009 and 2014 was 2,690 with a spike in 2010, when protests took place against alleged killings by the army in the Macchil sector.
The PDP-BJP government, headed initially by Mufti Mohammed Sayeed and then, after his death, by his daughter Mehbooba Mufti, recorded a high of 4,522 cases against stone-pelters with a huge spike of 2,897 cases in 2016 amid widespread protests over the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen militant commander Burhan Wani in an encounter with security forces and rising disgruntlement against the PDP for joining hands with the BJP.
Data over a decade also suggests that Srinagar, the base of the pro-Pakistan umbrella separatist group Hurriyat Conference, witnesses the most number of instances of stone-pelting. Sopore, a hotbed of the Jamaat-e-Islami, Kashmir and Tehreek-e-Hurriyat activity, Baramulla and Pulwama aren't far behind.
According to counter-terrorism operatives, there are a total of 300 terrorists in the valley currently, of which 115 are of Pakistani or Afghan nationality. The focus of security agencies is to not allow these numbers to go up by stopping replenishment from across the border and putting an end to the recruitment of local young men in South Kashmir.

'Crores' Sent By Centre Every Year Gobbled Up By Few Ruling Families:Madhav

SRINAGAR, Aug. 2 -- BJP national general secretary Ram Madhav on Thursday accused "few ruling families" of gobbling up "thousands of crores of rupees" given to the state by the Centre every year as a result of which "nothing reaches the people".
The BJP leader said a campaign has been started by the Narendra Modi-led government against corruption in Jammu and Kashmir.
"A huge campaign has been started by Modi government to end the corruption in the state. We will not let off anyone. A major scam in J&K Bank is being unearthed and big names are coming to the fore.
"Irrespective of their political affiliations or even if they have served as ministers or something else, we will urge the government to take stern action against them for gobbling public money. They will be taken to Srinagar (Central) jail," he said.
The BJP national general secretary was addressing a workers' rally at Balhama in Pampore on the outskirts of the city here.
Madhav said some political parties and individuals were supporting militancy in Jammu and Kashmir and said peace will not be established till they are not taught a lesson.
He said some political parties, due to their own interests, either indirectly allow terrorism to sprout or sometimes even directly support it.
"There are those who give the terrorists money or those who support terror ideology, whether they are political or non-political groups, be it Hurriyat Conference or Jamaat-e-Islami, or individuals, as long as you do not teach them a lesson, peace won't come," Madhav said.
He said the government has started the task of "mending" those leaders who indulge in this type of politics.
"Those who support separatism, terrorism, send their own children abroad for studies, but make innocent children here victims of terror. The government has taken the task of "mending" those leaders who do this type of politics," Madhav said.
Madhav said the BJP will hold a debate with the supporters of Article 370, and also questioned why big industries were not coming to the state.
The BJP national secretary said the party wants the dignified return of Kashmiri Pandits to the valley. Later, he visited the Bala Devi temple at Balhama and also interacted with the members of the Kashmiri Pandits Welfare Committee.

During investigation, it said, identity of the three Fidayeen militants was established. The two local militants among the attackers were identified as Fardeen Ahmad Khandey son of Gulam Mohi-ud--din Khandey of Nazneenpora, Tral, Pulwama and Manzoor Ahmad Baba son of Ali Mohammad of Drubgam, Pulwama, while, the identity of the third Fidayeen was identified as Abdul Shakoor, a resident of Rawalakot, PaK.
"Recce of the CRPF Group Centre, Lethpora was done by Noor Mohd Tantray along with other accused during the second week of December 2017. However, before the attack could be launched, Noor Mohd Tantray was killed in an encounter with security forces," NIA said in a statement issued here.
"Mufti Waqas, a Pakistani militant of JeM who took over as commander after Noor Mohammad, immediately started planning the execution of attack at CRPF Group centre, Lethpora to retaliate against the killing of Noor Tantray."
Accused Syed Hilal Andrabi, Irshad Ahmad Reshi, Fayaz Ahmad Magray, Nisar Ahmad Tantray, Mudasir Ahmad Khan and JeM commander Mufti Waqas (Pakistani) played a vital role in the conspiracy, the NIA said. "Mufti Waqas and Mudasir Ahmad Khan were later killed in different encounters with security forces."
Accused Fayaz Ahmad Magray was an active associate of slain Noor Mohd. "Tantray and he played an active role in planning and execution of this attack. After the attack, in the month of January 2018, the role of Mudasir Ahmad khan who was an OGW of JeM at that time came into knowledge of Police and a raid was conducted at his house."
Fayaz Ahmad Magray, the NIA said, immediately facilitated Mudasir Ahmed khan to join the JeM militant ranks as an active militant by arranging weapon through JeM commander Mufti Waqas. He also escorted him and helped him to cross the police check posts while escaping.
The Accused Syed Hilal Andrabi and Irshad Ahmed Reshi facilitated the fidayeen attack by providing shelter, by extending logistic support and by transporting the fidayeens along with their arms and ammunition immediately before the attack, the NIA said. "The fourth accused charge-sheeted namely Nisar Ahmad Tantray is the younger brother of slain JeM commander Noor Mohd Tantray and he was also part of the said conspiracy".
Further investigation continues in respect of other accused and cross border linkages of the attack, the NIA added.

ED attaches Kashmiri bizman's assets worth Rs 1.73 cr in terror funding case

India, Aug. 1 -- The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has attached businessman Zahoor Ahmad Shah Watali's assets worth Rs 1.73 crore in an alleged terror financing case involving Jamaat-ud-Dawa founder Hafiz Saeed, the agency said in a statement on Thursday.
It said the assets have been attached under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) in an ongoing investigation against Saeed, Hizb-ul-Mujahideen chief Syeed Salahuddin among others.
The ED added the assets include immovable properties worth Rs 1.48 crore in the names of Watali's family members and Rs 25 lakh bank balance in the Jammu & Kashmir Bank.
The probe under the PMLA was initiated in the case based on a National Investigation Agency (NIA) charge sheet against Saeed, Salahuddin and others. "...Watali has been found to be involved in fund-raising and as a financial conduit for [separatist] Hurriyat Leaders. NIA investigation also discloses that the All Party Hurriyat Conference (APHC) and other secessionists instigate the general public, especially the youth, to observe strikes and issue directives to the masses to hold anti-India protests, demonstrations and processions through press releases, newspapers and social media," the ED said.
"The secessionists instigate the masses to resort to violence especially stone-pelting on the security forces at encounter sites and also after the dispersal of Friday prayers. This has been done wilfully to create such circumstances which will arouse disaffection among the people of Jammu & Kashmir towards the Government of India."
The ED said its probe has found that the Hurriyat leaders allegedly received funds from Pakistan through conduits and also from the country's high commission in New Delhi. It added this was allegedly reflected in the seized documents.
The ED said documents indicate that Watali was allegedly receiving money from Saeed, Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence, the high commission and a person in Dubai. "...Watali was remitting the same to the Hurriyat leaders, separatists, and stone-pelters of Jammu & Kashmir."

A National Investigation Agency (NIA) team carried out fresh raids in north Kashmir's Baramulla district on Sunday to crack down on cross-LoC traders. India had stopped trading with Pakistan after the Pulwama terror attack on February 14. Sources said the team, accompanied by police and CRPF personnel searched the houses of four men - Tanveer Ahmad, Asif Lone, Tariq Ahmad and Bilal Bhat - involved in cross-border trade.
On July 23, the agency had raided seven locations in Pulwama and Srinagar amid allegations that cross-LoC businesses were being used by terror groups in Pakistan to fund their counterparts in India. This money was, in turn, used to fuel terrorism in the Kashmir Valley. Among those raided was Tanveer Wani, president of cross-LoC traders' association in south Kashmir's Pulwama district. Earlier, NIA had conducted raids in several parts of Kashmir and arrested several separatist leaders and some businessmen over their alleged involvement in terror funding. Most of them are lodged in New Delhi's Tihar jail.

Jammu and Kashmir ‘build-up’ a response to ISI planning strikes in run-up to I-Day

SRINAGAR: Dispelling rumours of the paramilitary build-up in J&K being linked to any plan to abrogate Articles 35A and 370, a top intelligence official on Sunday revealed that the exercise was a precaution against Pakistan’s ISI planning terror strikes in the run-up to Independence Day in a bid to shore up the sagging morale of separatist forces. News of additional 100 companies of paramilitary forces being sent to the valley had added grist to the rumour mills about an “impending” abrogation of Article 35A, which allows the J&K legislature to define who is a permanent resident, and Article 370, which grants the state autonomous status.According to the intelligence official, the security establishment was merely trying to prevent any misadventure by ISI before Independence Day or later.
He said the crackdown by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on separatist elements and sources of terror funding had sharply reduced the scale of terrorism in Kashmir and made the ISI increasingly desperate. “There has been an increase in tourist arrivals. Hotels are full. There has also been a surge in the number of Amarnath pilgrims, whereas incidents of stone-pelting have declined. There have been fewer strike calls lately, all of which add up to a picture that undermines Pakistan’s depiction of J&K as a tinderbox,” the official said.He said all inputs from intelligence agencies point to Pakistan-based handlers of terrorists in the valley raring to disrupt the return of normalcy. Some might even be tempted to interpret US President Donald Trump’s recent meeting with Pakistan PM Imran Khan as a signal for them to step up violence in the valley, he said. An opposing theory still doing the rounds is that the Supreme Court’s verdict for or against Article 35A might trigger unrest in the valley, a possibility that has prompted Delhi to send additional forces in advance. “As of now, the matter is in court,” a source said, stopping short of ruling out the possibility of BJP implementing its manifesto promise to do away with the contentious constitutional provision.

Take people, J&K political parties into confidence: D Raja

NEW DELHI, July 28 -- After additional security forces were deployed in Kashmir Valley in the wake of inputs about a terror attack threat, CPI general secretary D Raja on Sunday said the central government should take people and political parties of Jammu and Kashmir into confidence.
"It is a serious thing. However, the government should take people and political parties in Jammu and Kashmir into confidence. There is a trust deficit between the people and the political parties which should be overcome," he told reporters.
"National security is of paramount importance for everybody. People have apprehensions of whatever the Centre is doing in Kashmir valley. The centre should take meaningful steps to reach out to the people and political parties in Jammu and Kashmir," he added.
Raja's comments came amid reports that after receiving inputs about the terrorist attack threat, NSA Ajit Doval held a meeting of counter-terrorism grid in Jammu and Kashmir to review the security situation in the Kashmir valley.
Reports quoting anonymous top sources in the security establishment said after this assessment by the NSA, the government felt the need for deploying additional forces there. The security establishment has confirmed inputs that Pakistan army-backed terrorist groups are planning to carry out a major attack on Indian soil which is why 100 companies of paramilitary groups have been deployed in the Kashmir valley to strengthen counter-terrorism grid in the area.
Inputs have been received by the security and spy agencies that after the successful conduct of Panchayat elections in the state, terrorist groups have been asked to carry out an attack on forces.
"NSA Ajit Doval is constantly in touch with the security agencies to monitor the situation and is keeping a close eye on developments in the state. The peaceful conduct of Amarnath Yatra which saw a record number of pilgrims taking part has also irked the terrorists and their handlers in Pakistan and Pakistan Army's spy agency ISI. After a considerable gap this year, Pakistani terrorist groups tried to infiltrate into the Indian territory yesterday in the Machhil sector but the attempt was foiled by the alert jawans of the Indian army. In view of the threat perception, the security forces including the army and CRPF units are maintaining the highest levels of vigil to foil any misadventure in their area of responsibility. NSA Ajit Doval is constantly in touch with the security agencies to monitor the situation and is keeping a close eye on developments in the state," reports said quoting sources.

SRINAGAR, July 28 -- The National Investigation Agency (NIA) today conducted searches at the residences of four Cross-Line of Control (LoC) traders in this old town in north Kashmir in terror funding case, an official said.
The raids come just days after the investigation agency carried out searches at seven locations in south Kashmir district of Pulwama and Srinagar at the properties of businessmen associated with the Cross-LoC trade, which is allegedly used by militants to send money into the state to spread trouble.
Assisted by security forces and state police personnel, sleuths of NIA conducted raid at the residences of businessmen Tariq Ahmad, Bilal Bhat, Asif Ahmad Lone and Tanveer Ahmad.
The official said early on Sunday morning, security forces and state police personnel sealed all roads leading to the residences of the four businessmen in old town Baramulla.
Later, the NIA sleuths conducted searches in their houses, he said, adding that the operation was still going on when the reports last came in. He said all the four are cross-LoC traders.
On July 23, searches were conducted by NIA in Achgoza in Pulwama at the premises of Tanveer Ahmad Wani, who is the President of the cross-LoC traders Association. Raids were also conducted in the Safakadal, Bemina and Parimpora fruit markets in Srinagar. "During the searches, incriminating documents, including photographs and documents, allegedly related to Cross-LoC trade irregularities, were uncovered. Besides, electronic devices and other material have also been seized," the NIA had said.
The NIA in a statement had said that reliable information was received that a large scale transfer of funds from Pakistan to India has been taking place through the import of California almonds via the Cross-LoC trade.
The trade between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad, capital of Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK), was suspended from March 8 after reports that it (trade) was being used for terror funding. Trade was suspended after Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) fidayeen attack in February this year left 44 CRPF personnel dead and scores injured at Awantipora on the Srinagar-Jammu National Highway. The Karvan-e-Aman bus operating between Srinagar and PoK also remained suspended since March 8.
The NIA and Enforcement Directorate (ED) have so far arrested over two dozen separatist leaders and businessmen in the Kashmir valley in connection with terror funding.

Acquitted and free but where is justice or principles of equality
By Anuradha Bhasin Jamwal.

Jammu, July 28 -- 5 men walked out of Jaipur jail last week relieved do be finally free after being wrongly framed on terror charges. But freedom came after 23 years, the best part of their years having become static inside the bare walls of a prison while the world was moving on. All these men now in the age group of 39 and 57 were at the prime of their youth, one a teenager studying in school, when they were arrested for a blast on the Agra-Jaipur highway, a day after the Lajpat Nagar blast in 1996. The court acquitted all five, four of them from Jammu and Kashmir (three from Kashmir and one from Doda). They were finally released but it is difficult for them to pick up their lives after having lost so much.
This is not the first case of its kind. Similar charges have been propped up against innocent people and they have languished in jails for years till the long-drawn trials consume their lives behind the bars before they are proclaimed innocent. In this particular case, one of the accused died during his incarceration and this is a glaring evidence of how such cases are a complete travesty of justice. Picked up on mere whims or as part of a vendetta, these people are not only the victims of lacunae in the legal justice system but also of the majoritarian discourse that gullibly gulps down all lies fed to them in the name of investigations. That it is mostly Muslims who bear the brunt of flawed and tardy legal justice system is well document.
In a detailed investigative report in 2012, titled "Framed, Damned and Acquitted", Jamia Milia Islamia Teachers' Solidarity Association (JTSA) nailed the partisan probes in 16 high profile cases and concluded that all those arrested were framed by various security agencies. Most of those framed were Kashmiris. Calling it as "proverbial tip of iceberg" the JTSA maintained that its investigation was purely based on court judgments. "We document here 16 cases in which those accused of being operatives of various terrorist organizations, arrested by the Special Cell of Delhi Police, were acquitted by the courts, not simply for want of evidence, but because the evidence was tampered with, and the police story was found to be unreliable and incredulous" reads the preface of 171-page report. In its demand note JTSA had asked the government to take corrective steps to arrest this growing trend. Among other things it had sought a public apology from the government and action against the investigating agency for the wrongful arrests, prosecution and prolonged incarceration of hapless innocent people.
Scores of innocent Kashmiris have fallen prey to machinations of investigating agencies which have been framing the young people in false and fabricated cases. When a Kashmiri is arrested or booked in such a case outside the state, it becomes extremely difficult for him and his family to get a good defence lawyer. Usually lawyers are also hesitant to take up their cases either due to their own prejudiced mindset or due to intimidation. A hostile environment coupled with an ultra-nationalist discourse proclaims them culprits and terrorists right from the word go, defeating the very essence of jurisprudence of criminal law, according to which any accused is to be deemed innocent till proven otherwise. A wrongful consent about their criminality is so manufactured than even after their acquittals, after following due process of law, they continue to live with the tag of "terrorism" and "terrorist".
That deep-rooted prejudices are one of the major factors behind the sufferings of such people who are never compensated for the wrongful confinement is evident from the very different manner in which trials of terror accused belonging to the majority Hindu community have progressed. All the accused, all Hindutva ideologues, in Samjhauta train blast accused, were acquitted earlier this year by a special NIA Court which concluded that the investigating agency has "failed to prove the conspiracy charge and ruled that accused deserve a benefit of doubt". One of the main accused, Swami Aseemanand, was euloguised by none other than the union home minister Amit Shah who also mislead the Rajya Sabha with his claim that "the investigative agencies did not have sufficient proof against the accused persons". On the contrary, the judgement that acquitted the accused indicted the NIA for not producing the best evidence to back the chargesheet. Clearly spelt, they had the evidence but did not produce it. This is unlike the many cases in which evidence does not exist or has been planted to nail Muslims on trumped up terror charges. Instead of talking about re-investigating the Samjhauta case afresh with proper evidence in light of the court verdict, the home minister spoke about a political conspiracy behind framing the accused and calling it an onslaught on Hinduism and Hindu activists. He has legitimized an existing prejudice that terrorists come from only one community.
The case of Sadhvi Pragya, accused in the Malegaon bombings of 2008 is an even more striking example of the manner in which the terror accused are weighed on grounds of their identity. She was arrested after her bike used for the crime was found. Last year she was released on bail on medical grounds. Yet, she was healthy enough to contest parliamentary elections. Still a main accused in the terror case, she was voted to parliament with a huge majority. A Muslim terror accused, however, will continue to live with the same tag of 'terrorist' even after clear acquittal.

In a major breakthrough, security forces gunned down dreaded Pakistani terrorist, a top commander of Jaish-e-Muhammed, in an encounter in south Kashmir's Shopian district on Saturday. Lahori was an expert in making IEDs and was responsible for a series of civilian killings in the area and attacks on security forces elsewhere in J&K.
Another local Kashmiri terrorist was also killed in the gunfight. He has been identified as Mir Zeenat Ul Islam of Turkawanghom in Shopian.
On credible inputs that some terrorists were present in the Banday Mohalla Bonbazar area of Shopian town, a cordon-and-search operation was launched jointly by SOG and Army in the wee hours of Saturday, a police spokesman said. During the search operation, the hiding terrorists fired upon the search party. The fire was retaliated, leading to the encounter and subsequent killings of the two terrorists, he added."Bodies of the two terrorists were retrieved from the site of the encounter," the spokesman said, adding that while Lahori belonged to Jaish, Zeenat was a member of Hizbul Mujahideen.
Both the terrorists were wanted by law for their complicity in several crimes, including attacks on security establishments and civilian atrocities, he said. "Lahori was involved in planning and executing a series of attacks on security establishments and many other civilian atrocities in the area. He played a major role in the IED blast on security forces in Arihal area of Pulwama on June 17 this year in which two security personnel were killed," the spokesman said.
The slain Jaish terrorist was also responsible for two car blast attacks targeting security force vehicles this year - one at Banihal in Ramban on March 30 and the other at Arihal in Pulwama on June 17, he said. Lahori was involved in recruiting locals into terrorist ranks," he added.
Meanwhile, an Army soldier was killed in cross-border firing initiated by Pakistan to facilitate infiltration of terrorists in Machil sector of frontier Kupwara district of north Kashmir on Saturday.

For that Butt had built a cavity in a car and brought weapons to Bareilly in Uttar Pradesh,” Jadeja said.Jadeja further said that in Bareilly, Chandkhan alias Shanmiya had introduced Butt to other accused. “From here, Chandkhan and another accused Shakil came to Ahmedabad with AK-47 rifles and executed the terror attack on September 24, 2002.
Chandkhan was arrested arrested in 2003, but he did not reveal Butt’s involvement in the terror attack,” he added.ATS sources said that after the terror attack, Butt had fled to PoK (Pakistan occupied Kashmir). Recently, he was traced in Anantnag. A team of ATS and SOG officials with help of local police apprehended Butt. Preliminary interrogation revealed that Butt used to work in a wood warehouse. He will be produced before a special court, where the investigators are likely to seek his custodial interrogation. On September 24, 2002, thirty-four persons including an NSG commando were killed and 86 persons sustained injuries when two militants stormed the temple in Gandhinagar. Both the militants were shot down by the NSG commandos the next morning. Police had arrested six persons in this case for providing logistic support to the two fidayeen. Three of them were sentenced to death, while three others got imprisonment of different terms after special Pota court held them guilty. The Supreme Court acquitted them on May 16, 2014 and rapped Gujarat police for its investigation.

Amendments to UAPA

Jammu, July 27 -- With the latest amendments proposed to Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) and rules governing the working of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) by the NDA-government have the potential of gross misuse. While doing so, some of the amendments in the UAPA have also the potential of undermining the federal structure of the country as all the powers are proposed to be vested in the central government despite law and order being the state subject under the constitutional provisions of the country. Moreover, designating an individual as a terrorist raises serious constitutional questions and has the potential of misuse by the centre. Under the existing laws, the practice of designating individuals under anti-terrorism laws, prevalent in several countries, is seen as being necessary because banned groups tend to change their names and continue to operate. However, there is no set procedure for designating an individual as a terrorist.
The Parliament must consider whether an individual can be called a 'terrorist' prior to conviction in a court of law. The absence of a judicial determination in such cases may render the provision vulnerable to invalidation. There has to be a distinction between an individual and an organisation, as the former enjoys the right to life and liberty under the constitutional provisions. The likely adverse consequences of a terrorist tag may be worse for individuals than for groups. Moreover, individuals may be subjected to arrest and detention, even after obtaining bail from the courts, they may have their travel and movements restricted, besides carrying the taint. This makes it vital that individuals have a faster means of redressal from the courts than groups. Unfortunately, there is no change in the process of getting an entity removed from the list under the existing provisions of law. Just as any organisation getting the tag, individuals, too, will have to apply to the centre to get their names removed. This process may become tedious for the individuals in the absence of a judicial remedy available in other penal codes in the country. Apart from this, the powers for doing so will be vested in the central government and the regime may or may not entertain such requests from the individuals if they happen to be from the opposition political parties.
Apart from this, a wrongful designation by the concerned authorities will cause irreparable damage to a person's reputation, career and livelihood. Union Home Minister Amit Shah's warning that his government would not spare terrorists or their sympathisers, and his reference to 'urban Maoists', have dangerous potential about the possibility of misuse. It has been argued by some members in Parliament that the Bill contains anti-federal features that take away the rights of the states for redressal of such mistakes. The provision to empower the head of the NIA to approve the forfeiture of property of those involved in terrorism cases obviously overrides a function of the state government. At present, the approval has to be given by the police heads of respective states. Besides this, there will be a section allowing NIA Inspectors to investigate terrorism cases, as against a Deputy Superintendent of Police or an Assistant Commissioner. This significantly enhances the scope for misuse by the concerned officers of the NIA, which is under the direct command and control of the central government and state government do not enjoy powers to check the operations of the NIA. The 2004 amendments to the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, made it a comprehensive anti-terror law that provided for punishing acts of terrorism, as well as for designating groups as 'terrorist organisations'. Parliament further amended it in 2008 and 2013 to strengthen the legal framework to combat terror. While none will question the need for stringent laws that show 'zero tolerance' towards terrorism, the central government should be mindful of its obligations to preserve fundamental rights while enacting legislation on the subject. Also, the central government also has an obligations to protect the civil and personal liberties of the citizens in the country.

Ahmedabad, July 27 -- Mohammad Yasin Bhat, alleged prime conspirator of the 2002 Akshardham Temple attack in Gandhinagar, was arrested by the Gujarat Anti-Terrorist Squad from south Kashmir's Anantnag on Friday, an official said on Friday. Thirty-three persons were killed when two terrorists opened fire inside the temple complex here on September 24, 2002. He was nabbed on Thursday following a tip-off that he had returned to Jammu and Kashmir and was working at a timber warehouse in Anantnag.

Gen Rawat warns Pak against Kargil repeat

New Delhi, July 27 -- Twenty years after Pakistani regulars and the armed militants supported by it were bombed by Indian forces from the mountains in Kargil, Islamabad has been warned not to repeat its mistake by Indian Army Chief General Bipin Rawat.
General Bipin Rawat couldn't have been more direct in his advice: "You will get a bloodier nose," he told Pakistan, if it chose to repeat Kargil-like misadventure. "Don't do it. Misadventures are normally not repeated. You will get a bloodier nose next time," he said in a press conference when asked to articulate his message to Pakistan on the 20th anniversary of India's victory in the Kargil war.
July 26 is celebrated as Kargil Vijay Diwas every year to mark India's triumph over Pakistan on this day in 1999.
General Rawat suggested that Pakistan's promises to act against militants and their networks couldn't be trusted as it was only meant to secure international funding. "There is a difference between talk and action. We all know the situation in Pakistan right now. We all know who controls the country. They are ready for anything to get money. Once they get it, they will do what they have been doing for the last so many years," he said.
General Rawat accused Pakistan of making "desperate attempt" to keep the Kashmir issue alive as it stood exposed sponsoring terror on Indian soil. "The world at large knows terrorists are trained in Pakistan and they have terror camps," he stressed while adding that Islamabad supported militants with money and weaponry to the terrorists.
He further accused Pakistan of influencing people from across the border to join hands with the local youth to up the ante of terrorism. Radicalisation and social media were being extensively used to fuel trouble in Jammu and Kashmir, he said.

Why was Trump in a hurry to please Imran?

Srinagar, July 26 -- President Donald J Trump claims Prime Minister Narendra Damodardas Modi asked him to intervene and mediate in resolving the Kashmirissue when they met on the sidelines of the G-20 summit in Osaka on June 28. This claim has predictably raised shackles in India and ecstasy in Pakistan.
Interestingly, the statement issued after the Osaka meeting, by no less than Trump's favourite child Ivanka, merely spoke of the two leaders discussed issues pertaining to 5G communications and technology and its security implications, apart from Iran and bilateral trade relations.
There were no references at all by Ivanka to any 'revolutionary' offers made by Trump to mediate on the Kashmir issue, allegedly in response to a plea from Prime Minister Modi for such intervention.
Statements issued by both the US state department and the White House after the Trump-Imran Khan meeting on July 22 pointedly made no reference to any offer of mediation on the issue of Jammu and Kashmir.
Trump's comments predictably raised hackles in Parliament. There were strong demands for a response personally from the prime minister. Not surprisingly, Mr Modi refused to oblige as his personal relations with his counterparts in major world capitals are important and indeed crucial.
These personal relations need to be handled sensitively, but firmly. External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, therefore, voiced the official response to the Trump comments in Parliament. Mr Modi will, no doubt, respond to Trump's outrageous comments at a time, place and manner of his choosing.
Trump's comments, after all, outrageously alleged that Prime Minister Modi had sought his mediation on an issue affecting India's unity and territorial integrity.
Why was Donald Trump in such a hurry to please Imran Khan for whom he had strong words of praise for his qualities of head and heart?
Trump has, after all, in the past, been scathingly critical of Pakistan for hosting Osama bin Laden for years in Abbotabad, a cantonment town near Islamabad. Osama lived in a house located close to Pakistan's military academy.
Imran Khan now claims that if the Pakistan army knew where Osama was hiding, they would have handed him over to the US immediately!!
The reality that drives Trump's behaviour is his domestic agenda of keeping his white, racist, vote bank happy. Trump is now predominantly focused on preparing for the next presidential election on November 3, 2020.
His white supporters, given to hurling abuse at religious and ethnic minorities like Muslims and African Americans, are tired of their 'boys' dying in combat in inhospitable and difficult conditions in a distant Islamic country.
The War in Afghanistan, which commenced after the terrorist attacks on New York, has now lasted nearly 18 years. While some masterminds of the 9/11 terrorist strikes, like bin Laden, have been eliminated, others like Ayman al-Zawahiri are still around, evidently with ISI support, living and moving along the Pakistan/Afghanistan border.
American estimates in 2018 indicate that 2,372 American soldiers have been killed and 25,320 wounded in the Afghanistan conflict which has cost the US exchequer over $2.4 trillion.
Trump's new discovery is that Pakistan and its army are virtually god's gift to mankind. They are required to facilitate a relatively orderly American exit from Afghanistan.
In seeking to achieve this objective, Trump has extensively used the services of an ambitious Afghan American, ZalmayKhalilzad, who has sought to appease the Taliban, by excluding the Afghan government, led by President Ashraf Ghani, from the talks he holds with the Taliban.
Ghani himself assumed office thanks to some deft diplomacy by then US secretary of state John Kerry!!
What we are now heading for in Afghanistan is an American withdrawal, with large tracts of the country under Taliban control. This will inevitably be followed by conflicts between militias backed by different ethnic groups.
China will need to deal with radical Islamist groups who will, for Beijing, hopefully and with some Pakistani assistance, not make common cause with their oppressed fellow Muslims in neighbouring Xinjiang province.
Thanks to its imaginative aid programme, India has won immense goodwill in the minds of the Afghan people.
Pakistan will, nevertheless, move to immediately ensure that the Indian consulates in Jalalabad, Kandahar, Herat and Mazar e Sharif shut down. The Lashkar e Tayiba and Jaish e Mohammed have earlier carried out attacks on our consulates in Jalalabad, Herat and Mazar e Sharif and even on our mission in Kabul.
We will, therefore, have to see how we can manage diplomatically and in terms of security arrangements. One can only hope that the Afghan national army remains firm, disciplined and united.

NEW DELHI, July 25 -- "India has persistently taken up with Pakistan the issue of cross-border terrorism, including funding of secessionist and terror activities in Jammu and Kashmir, but Islamabad is yet to take any action against it," the government said on Thursday.
In written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha, Minister of State for External Affairs V Muraleedharan said, "Pakistan has been asked to abide by its commitment to not allow any territory under its control to be used for terrorism against India in any manner and take credible, verifiable and irreversible steps in the matter." "Pakistan is yet to demonstrate such steps," he said.
"The government has, through diplomatic channels, persistently taken up with Pakistan, the issue of cross-border terrorism, including funding of secessionist and terrorist activities in the state of Jammu and Kashmir," he said.
To another question on relations with neighbouring countries, the minister said that with Pakistan, the government desires normal neighbourly relations and is committed to addressing all outstanding issues bilaterally and peacefully in accordance with the Shimla Agreement and the Lahore Declaration.
"However, any meaningful dialogue can only be held in an atmosphere free from terror, hostility and violence," he said.
"The onus is on Pakistan to create such a conducive atmosphere," Muraleedharan said.

A bridge across the India-Pakistan abyss

Copyright 2019. The Kashmir Monitor
Srinagar, July 25 -- Ties between India and Pakistan are at an ebb - their lowest in two decades. The thread from this phase, as a series of events - the Kargil war (1999), the Agra Summit (2001), the attack on Parliament (2001) and Operation Parakram (2001-02) - meant a sustained period of deep hostilities, with diplomatic missions downgraded and travel routes truncated. Since 2015 and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Lahore visit in the same year, the leaders of both countries have not met for talks. In mid-2018, the backchannel diplomacy between the National Security Advisers of both countries was called off by Pakistan, while in September 2018, India called off a planned meeting between the Foreign Ministers in New York. In the wake of the Pulwama terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir in February this year, India attacked terror targets in Pakistan which in turn sent fighter jets to the border.
Subsequently, after India moved missiles and deployed submarines, Pakistan raised a full air alert and imposed an airspace ban that lasted till mid-July.
What has been disconnected from all those tensions are the talks on the Kartarpur corridor. The offer from Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan to open the corridor was conveyed first by Pakistan Army Chief General QamarJavedBajwa, and accepted by Mr. Modi, marking a rare moment of coordination between the two nations.
That the talks have continued through one of the most difficult years in the relationship is equally remarkable; there have been three rounds of technical-level meetings to ensure both sides complete the infrastructure needed before November 2019, the 550th anniversary of Sikhism's founder Guru Nanak.
The symbolism for pilgrims who will be able to travel from Dera Baba Nanak town in Punjab to the GurdwaraDarbar Sahib Kartarpur just a few kilometres inside Pakistan, which are sites where Guru Nanak spent his last few years, goes well beyond the date and year. This is a route that the Guru and his followers traversed with ease for half a millennium until Partition resulted in the India-Pakistan border cutting through it. While Sikh pilgrims have been given easy access since then to Guru Nanak's birthplace at Nankana Sahib, the circuitous 200 km route to Kartarpur via Amritsar-Wagah has been off limits. The Kartarpur shrine has one of the last copies of the original Guru Granth Sahib; there are some who believe that it contains not only the wisdom of the 10 Gurus but is itself the 11th and last Guru. Giving life to the wishes of so many will also ensure political dividends in India, an aspect no government in the State or at the Centre can ignore.
Despite the rich significance of the corridor, there were many reasons for the earlier hesitation to revive the project. The Kartarpur corridor project is an issue that has been raised by India for several decades, with New Delhi's reasons for wanting the corridor clear. However, in the case of Pakistan, these have not been as transparent, with the military establishment's surprise backing only raised doubts on whether Islamabad has an ulterior motive. In a dossier handed over during the last round of talks on Kartarpur on July 14, India spelt out its apprehensions over Pakistan allowing separatist Khalistani groups, including those funded by groups based in the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada, to try and influence pilgrims. Of specific concern is the 'Referendum 2020' plan by the Sikhs for Justice group (banned by India).
This group has already held a series of public events in the U.S. and the U.K. demanding a 'worldwide referendum' on a separate Sikh state. The other irritant is the possible use of the corridor for drugs and arms movement; there are many routes and tunnels at the border between the two Punjabs. The terror threat by Pakistani Punjab-based anti-India groups such as the Lashkar-e-Toiba and the Jaish-e-Mohammad is also a constant concern.
Agreeing to the Kartarpur corridor means the government has made an exception from a matter concerning national policy for a matter of faith. In the last few years, every avenue has been shut down from those for official, bilateral and regional (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) talks to even those for travel and tourism. Trade too has ground to a halt with cross-Line of Control (LoC) trade route suspension the latest casualty.
With such strictures in place, New Delhi's decision to embark on a course that will need regular and repeated India-Pakistan meetings is nothing short of a breach of its otherwise firm "no talks without terror ending" policy. For example, at a time when Indian and Pakistani Ministers do not even hold talks when they meet at multilateral conferences, New Delhi sent two senior Ministers to Pakistan to participate in the ground-breaking ceremony for the event. It remains to be seen who the government will send to the inauguration, and whether Mr. Modi, who has likened building the Kartarpur corridor to the fall of the Berlin wall, will grace the occasion.
With the Kartarpur exception to India's policy on Pakistan now established, it is necessary to see whether it can be built on to create a mechanism for broader conversations between India and Pakistan. The obvious extension from this would be for having other faith-based "corridors" for Hindu, Muslim and Sikh pilgrims in both countries; this would be in addition to the list of 20 shrines (15 in Pakistan, five in India) that were negotiated under the 1974 Protocol on visits to Religious Shrines.
The template that Kartarpur has given both sides is also worth considering for the format of other bilateral negotiations given that the talks have been immunised from both terror attacks and election rhetoric. The venue of the talks, at the Attari-Wagah zero point, lends itself to more successful outcomes too away from the glare of the media, without focus on arrangements for both parties. The two sides can cross over, meet for the duration of talks and return after issuing a pre-arranged joint statement. The timing of the Kartarpur opening may also lend itself to exploring other bilateral engagements.
Ahead of the next plenary of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in October, Pakistan will remain under pressure to keep terror groups subdued. According to various reports, infiltration figures at the LoC are significantly lower (a 43% reduction since the Balakot strikes in February); officials have marked about 20 terror camps in PoK they believe have been "shut down" recently. Civilian and military casualties from ceasefire violations have also reduced. Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan's government, which has been buoyed by Mr. Khan's U.S. visit and by Pakistan's new-found acceptance in the international community for its role in Taliban talks, and Mr. Modi's government, which has been bolstered by its strong electoral mandate, will also be in the strongest positions politically to forge agreements.
Thus, it would be a travesty to waste the opportunity made possible by the Kartarpur corridor, and by extension, the founder of the Sikh faith himself (revered by Hindus and Muslims in India and Pakistan) to bring both countries back to the table for talks. The most famous story at Kartarpur is the one of the 'miracle' that Guru Nanak wrought after his death as his Hindu and Muslim followers debated late into the night whether their Guru should be cremated or buried. When they awoke, his body had vanished, replaced by flowers which they divided up. The Guru Nanak's 'samadhi' and grave were built side by side. As pilgrims across the border pay a visit in November, it should be clear what the bigger miracle is: that the Kartarpur exception has been made at all.

Pak terror groups active in Kashmir, admits Imran

WASHINGTON/NEW DELHI, July 25 -- Some 40,000 trained militants with experience of fighting in Kashmir and Afghanistan are based on Pakistani soil, Prime Minister Imran Khan admitted on Tuesday night, but added his country cannot be blamed for the Pulwama suicide attack as it was carried out by a Kashmiri youngster.
Khan acknowledged the presence of the large number of militants in his country during an interaction at the US Institute of Peace, a Washington-based think tank funded by the US Congress. Khan contended his government was being backed by the powerful military in efforts to disarm the militants.
Asked about his government's efforts to crack down on terrorist leaders such as Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) founder Hafiz Saeed and banned groups such as the Jaishe-Mohammed (JeM), which claimed the Pulwama attack that killed 40 Indian troopers and triggered a face-off between the two countries, Khan sought to create the impression that the suicide bombing was the work of a local affected by the situation in Kashmir.
People familiar with the developments in New Delhi reacted to Khan's remarks by saying the Pakistani leadership continues to refuse to accept the Pulwama bombing as an act of terrorism. "JeM claimed responsibility and the group and its leader Masood Azhar are based in Pakistan," said a person who did not want to be named.
Khan contended his government was the first to decide that there would be no armed militias inside Pakistan. "Until we came into power, the governments did not have the political will," he added.

Jammu, July 25 -- A Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) militant, who was active for the last one year, was arrested from Phagsoo forest of Jammu and Kashmir's Kishtwar district on Wednesday.
Jamal-ud-din Gujjar, alias Abu Bakar, who had joined the terror outfit last year, was "injured" in an encounter with the security forces in Sarawan forest in Kishtwar in June this year and since then was hiding in the area, officials said.
Acting on reliable information about the movement of militants in the forest area of Thathri, a joint operation of District Police Doda and 26 Rashtriya Rifles had launched a search operation and cordoned the area, which falls under the jurisdiction of Thathri police station. "During the searches, the militant was caught alive by forces and was arrested from Phagsoo forest. An AK Rifle, AK magazine, a pouch and other edible items were recovered from the militant's possesion," the statement issued by police read.
The militant, who belonged to Keshwan in Kishtwar district, was carrying a reward of Rs.5 lakh, it added.
"He was active in Thakraie, Keshwan and Sarawan areas of the district," a top official confided to Hindustan Times over phone.
This is the security forces' first major recent success in Kishtwar, which was proclaimed terrorist-free a decade ago but was rattled by the killing of BJP state secretary Anil Parihar and his brother Ajeet Parihar on November 1 last year.On April 9, senior RSS leader Chanderkant Sharma and his security guard were shot dead inside a health centre.
When asked about possibilities of the militant being involved in the said killings, the official said, "Nothing can be said as of now. The matter is under investigation. Whether he (Din) had any direct or indirect involvement in the killings remains a subject of investigation."

Kashmiri carried out Pulwama, we were needlessly blamed: Pak PM Imran Khan

India, July 24 -- Prime Minister Imran Khan on Tuesday claimed Pakistan was needlessly blamed for the Pulwama attack in February, which he said was carried out by a local disaffected Kashmiri and the Jaish-e-Mohammad that took responsibility also operated in India. Pakistan was blamed without a reason.
He said in response to a question if the current crackdown on terrorists and militants in Pakistan would continued and if Hafiz Saeed, whose arrest for the eight time impressed only the US president Donald Trump, would stay in custody this time, and not be released as in previous instances.
Khan tried first to make light of the question that while the country wants and needs an independent judiciary he is being asked to predict what it would do. Without directly answering the Saeed arrest question, he said it was in Pakistan's interest to now get rid of all armed militias.
"It is in Pakistan's interest, it's in our interest," he continued. "The country has had enough of militant groups."
The prime minister said the security forces were with him on this. "It's the army that's helping us disarm all militant groups."
"It was clearly an indigenous thing," Khan went to say at a think tank, US Institute of Peace, referring to the Pulwama attack that took place in Kashmir. "It was a Kashmiri boy radicalized by the brutality the security forces. He blew himself up. But because this group claimed responsibility, which was in India as well, Jaish-e-Mohammad is operating in India - but Pakistan suddenly came in the limelight."

Jammu, July 24 -- Two brothers of an Indian Army soldier, who was abducted and killed by militants last year, have joined the armed forces to "serve the nation and avenge his death".
Mohammed Tariq, 23, and Mohammed Shabbir, 21, attended an enrolment parade of 100 new recruits in the Territorial Army in Rajouri on Monday, according to a defence spokesperson.
"They were enrolled into a territorial battalion on Monday and now they will undergo training at Punjab Regimental Centre," the spokesperson said. They posed with their parents Mohammed Hanif and Raaj Begum after donning the olive green. Hanif is also a former army man.
Aurangzeb was abducted in Pulwama and later killed by armed terrorists on June 14, 2018, when he was on his way back home in Poonch to celebrate Eid with his family. He was a rifleman in the army's 44 Rashtriya Rifles.
"Our brother gave his life for the nation and we will also follow in his footsteps. We will not step back when it comes to sacrificing our lives for the nation. We will make him and will Punjab regiment proud by our duty," said Tariq.
Their father Hanif, a former Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry soldier, said he may not live to see the "day but his two sons will take revenge of their brother Aurangzeb's killing."
"Tariq and Shabbir also want to serve the nation and protect their fellow citizens. Yes, I have lost my son Aurangzeb and death lurks a soldier but then not many have the guts to sacrifice their life for the nation," he said while speaking to HT over the phone.
"Aurangzeb was trapped and then killed by the cowards. We still miss him," Hanif said. Hanif joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) earlier this year in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi at a public rally in Vijaypur area of Samba district.

SRINAGAR, July 23 -- Police on Tuesday claimed to have arrested three aspiring militants of Hizbul Mujahideen (HM) outfit who are accused to be involved in several militant attacks in twin cities of the state including that of injuring an SPO at Barzulla area here earlier this year.
Addressing media at Shergari police station, Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Srinagar, Dr Haseeb Mughal said the arrested militants were associated with HM Commander Junaid Sehrai who planned and executed all these attacks. He also said the trio was about to join militant ranks under the mentorship of Sehrai.
He said besides objectionable material a huge cache of explosive including live cartridges were recovered from the possession of the arrested militants.
Elaborating, SSP said the three were involved in number of militant activities including grenade attacks in twin cities of Jammu and Kashmir and firing at SPO at Barzulla area.
The SSP identified the trio as Asif Iqbal Dar and Shahid Hassan Dar both residents of Soura and Rasheed Lateef Mir a resident of Barzulla.
"It's a matter of contentment for all of us that we prevented them from joining militant ranks, they were given a task to carry out a grenade attack in Jammu besides attacking and killing an SPO Ruman Raiees at Barzulla before joining the outfit. They had strict directions to kill the SPO," the SSP added.
Without divulging into details, the city police chief said Junaid Seharai who is son of Tehreek-e-Hurriyat Chairman, Mohammad Ashraf Sehrai's son was their mentor.
He said the police was closely monitoring the activities of one of the three militants, Asif Ahmad for the past several days "his family lodged a missing report after he left his home few days ago. The moment we started investigation to trace him, he returned back, he was much radicalized," said the SSP.
The city police chief further claimed that many shocking revelations came to fore during the course investigation. The trio was later presented before the media as well.
Meanwhile, a police spokesman in a statement said that Srinagar Police arrested three Hizb-ul-Mujahideen militants, who were involved in firing on SPO Romaan at Chanapora and several grenade throwing incidents and other incidents in Srinagar and Jammu cities.
"They were affiliated with HM and were wanted by law for their complicity in a series of terror crimes. The arrests were made after series of human and technical investigative techniques used by Police," spokesman said.
He said the trio had history of terror crime records and were involved in planning and executing several terror crimes in J&K along with their terror associates. During investigation it was learnt that Junaid Sehrai commander of HM was part of this group which carried out these attacks. They were involved in attack on SPO Romaan at Chanapora on 27/3/2019 in which he sustained injuries besides grenade throwing incidents in Jammu and Srinagar," police said.
Police added that incriminating materials including ammunition, live rounds were recovered from their possession. "A case under relevant sections of law has been registered in this regard. Further investigation in the matter is going on," police added.

Srinagar, July 23 -- Family's efforts and timely intervention has paid off after three youth who had recently joined militant ranks were arrested in Srinagar, police said on Tuesday.
Asif Iqbal Dar, Shahid Hassan Dar both from Soura, and Rasheed Latief Mir from Barzulla were affiliated with Hizbul Mujahideen (HM).
Addressing media persons, Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Srinagar, Dr Haseeb Mughal said Asif was on their radar for a long time.
"We have been following him for a long time. He has been sharing incriminating material on social media to inspire youth to join militant ranks. One fine day, he went missing and reached Pulwama following which parents lodged an FIR in police station Soura," Mughal said.
City police chief noted that efforts were made to trace the trio. "Help from other agencies was also sought. Ultimately all three of them reached their homes," he said.
Mughal said that their questioning revealed how youth are being recruited into the militant ranks.
"All the three were in close contact with Junaid Sehrai, a militant from Srinagar. They were receiving instructions from him. Before their debut into militancy, they were asked to carry some attacks, which they did," he claimed.
Mughal said the attack on Jammu Bus stand was the trio's handiwork. "They also fired at SPO Roman Rashid at Barzulla. Interestingly, they were told not to kill him. They even lobbed a grenade on the CRPF vehicle at Barzulla even though we have no record. It might have not exploded," he said.
The SSP said that youth were getting directions from Junaid Sehrai about the targets.
"For the time being, they were assigned smaller targets. Later they were supposed to get bigger targets. Some incriminating materials have been recovered from them including a grenade, some rounds and a flag of Ansar Ghazwat ul Hind," he added.
Urging youth not to fall prey to militant conspiracies, he appealed them to concentrate on productive things.
"Life is precious and you should make best use of it. Use your mind on productive things," he said.
Among others, Superintendent of Police (SP) West, Sudanshu Verma and SP South, Dr G V Sundeep were also present during the media conference.

Guv stirs another controversy

Jammu, July 23 -- Governor Satyapal Malik's latest controversial remarks asking militants to stop killing innocents and security personnel and instead target the corrupt persons amounts to sanctioning of violence. Such remarks coming from a man holding a constitutional position adds to the seriousness of its pernicious import. According to the Indian constitution, an individual is not supposed to deliberately kill another person without inviting prosecution by the state. It is more than worrying of a functionary of the state instead of encouraging citizens to uphold the law is found exhorting individuals to resort to taking law into their hands and engaging in homicides. Such open provocation to violence and violation of laws itself amounts to cognizable offence punishable under the Indian constitution. In the last three decades of insurgency and militarisation, the state's agencies are already facing many allegations of wrong-doing, human rights abuse and state sanctioned violence.
The State has also been critiqued for its policy of arming civilians to fight counter insurgency through creation of village defence committees and pursuing the policy of arming and patronizing renegade militants. The Governor has sought to legitimize the cult of violence by beseeching militants to re-direct their guns from security personnel to the people who are corrupt instead of assuring to nail them by following in all fairness a due process of law. There are enough existing Indian laws for prosecuting people who engage in corruption. By riding rough shod over the legal processes as per Indian law and calling for killings of people accused of corruption, effectively the Governor is batting for setting up of Kangaroo courts where mere accusations will be considered as valid sanction for murders. As per the Indian legal system, a person is deemed innocent till proven guilty.
That Malik juxtaposed his controversial and provocative remarks on Sunday followed his tirade against the political families and politicians of Kashmir shows where he was training his gun and also betrays the political agenda behind such remarks. Both the weight of the remarks and their possible political motive do not are incompatible with the position he holds. The comment came soon after his remark that "big families of Kashmir of accruing properties across the world by looting public money". This is not the first time that he has exhibited his blanket contempt for the Kashmiri politicians. During the last one year of his tenure, he has used several occasions to accuse political leaders, as well as bureaucrats, of Kashmir of corruption and having no mass support because of the poor turnout in elections. Politicians of all hues in the last few months are facing either corruption charges under his administration or income tax raids. While different political parties in Kashmir have alleged that such moves are vendetta and apprehensions have been aroused about several attempts to marginalize all Valley based politicians. On Monday, after a backlash over his comments, the Governor sought to engage in some damage control by stating that he had spoken "in a fit of anger and frustration" due to rampant corruption. Such explanations do not dilute or diminish the seriousness of his remarks. If corrupt practices and anger can be used to legitimize open invocation of violence and homicides, then by that logic the actions of youth, who pick up the gun angered and frustrated by the corrupt, manipulative and undemocratic political system and all its manifestations, will also gain a legitimacy. A man holding a constitutional position is expected to behave far more responsibly than the latter.

Curbs In Nowhatta; Friday Prayers Barred At Jamia

SRINAGAR, July 13 -- Authorities imposed curbs in Nowhatta area of Old Srinagar on Friday in wake of the third death anniversary of Sajad Ahmad Gilkar, who was killed along with two other militant associates, one of them a Hizb-ul-Mujahideen commander, in an encounter with government forces in Budgam district of central Kashmir on this day in 2017.
Reports said shops and business establishments remained closed in the downtown, including Nowhatta,
Gojwara, Rajouri Kadal, Naqashband sahib and Jamia Market, due to spontaneous shutdown and restrictions imposed by the authorities.
Sajad had gone missing on June 29, 2017 and joined Hizb-ul-Mujahideen militants. Sajad was accused by police of having played a "key role" in the lynching of police official Mohammed Ayoub Pandith outside the Jamia mosque in Srinagar on 23 June same year. The family had however contested the allegations, saying the police was falsely linking their son to various cases "under pressure."
The mandatory Friday congregational prayers were disallowed at historic Jamia Masjid as all four gates of the mosque were locked, witnesses said.
Hurriyat Conference (M) chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq was placed under house detention. Meanwhile, Hurriyat (M) and Awami Action Committee said that barring people from offering congregational Friday prayers at historic Jamia Masjid putting curbs in and around downtown is extremely unfortunate and interference in religious obligations of people.
It also castigated the decision of putting APHC chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq under house arrest. Mirwaiz was supposed to chair the meeting of AAC and Hurriyat at Mirwaiz Manzil regarding the March to martyr's graveyard at Naqashband Sahib (RA) shrine, Khawaja Bazar on July 13 (Saturday) to pay tributes to martyrs of July 13, 1931, but due to house arrest could not do so.
The statement said it is a 'highly undemocratic' aimed at throttling the freedom of speech and expression. Meanwhile, AAC recalled the great and supreme sacrifices of the martyrs of July 13, 1931 and paid tributes to them. AAC said that these martyrs were the first to raise their voice in J&K against the oppressive autocratic rule who sacrificed their life fighting it.
Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front and several other separatist groups also paid tribute to the martyrs.
The Kashmir High Court Bar Association said that on July 13, 1931, "the people of Kashmir stormed the gates of Central Jail, Srinagar and formed their way in the courtyard to watch the proceedings of a criminal case filed against one Abdul Qadeer, who was arrested for making a speech at Khankah-i-Moula for mobilizing the Muslims against the desecration of Holy Qur'an at Jammu police lines."
"On this, the District Magistrate, Srinagar, without making any attempt to pacify the people, ordered the police to open fire, in which 21 innocent Kashmiries got killed and more than 300 were arrested, alongwith their leaders and were put behind the bars," the lawyers body said.

SRINAGAR, July 12 -- Jammu and Kashmir Police achieved a breakthrough in the June 12 attack in Anantnag by arresting three overground workers of banned Jaish-e-Mohammed who provided shelter to a Pakistani militant who carried out the strike in which six people including station house officer Arshad Ahmed Khan were killed, officials said Thursday.
After the incident, crack teams were formed under the command of Senior Superintendent of Police Altaf Khan, who carried out investigation into the attack at busy KP road in Anantnag, they said.
The investigation led them to three youths -- Amir, Kaisar and Irfan -- who were allegedly working as overground workers for the terror group, they said.
The Pakistani militant was kept in the house of one of these three youths for nearly four days during which he was taken around the Anantnag town for scouting for potential targets for carrying out the strike.
The trio, during their interrogation, told the police that the terrorist was brought by local Jaish commander Fayaz Punzoo.On June 12, the Pakistani militant carried out the strike killing five CRPF personnel on the spot besides injuring station house officer Khan, who succumbed to his injuries four days later.
Khan had reached the spot within four minutes after the strike and was injured after he was hit by a bullet near his waist.
Recently, Home Minister Amit Shah, during his maiden official trip to the Kashmir valley, had visited the residence of Khan and expressed his condolences to the family.
Shah had termed Khan as a brave son of the country and also handed over a letter of employment to the wife of the police officer.

India can repeal Article 370 at will: Centre

New Delhi,NATIONAL Minister says UN or any country has no say The government informed Parliament that “no foreign government or organisation has any locus standi ” in repealing Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir as matters relating to the Constitution were internal and only for the Indian Parliament to deal with.
Minister of State for Home G. Kishan Reddy said in a written response in the Rajya Sabha that Jammu and Kashmir was an integral part of India.
While responding to a question on whether repeal of Articles 370 and 35A will in any way violate any United Nations regulation or any international obligation of the country, Mr. Reddy said, “Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India. Matters relating to the Constitution of India are internal and entirely for the Indian Parliament to deal with. No foreign government or organisation has any locus standi in the matter.”
Home Minister Amit Shah recently told the Lok Sabha that Article 370 was a “temporary provision”. Mr. Reddy said, “At present, Article 35A is contained in the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954 which was added through the Constitution Order issued by the President of India under Article 370.”
The two provisions let the J&K legislature decide the “permanent residents” of the State, prohibits a non-J&K resident from buying property in the State and ensures job reservation for its residents.
Replying to a separate question, Mr. Reddy said that after the Pulwama terror attack, 93 terrorists had been killed in Jammu and Kashmir.
On February 14, 40 CRPF personnel were killed when a car-borne bomber of Jaish-e-Mohammad rammed a CRPF bus in Pulwama.
The Minister said that when compared with the corresponding period of 2018, the first half of this year has witnessed a reduction in terrorism by 28%, reduction in net infiltration by 43% and increase in neutralisation of terrorists by 22%.

NEW DELHI: The home ministry on Wednesday informed the Rajya Sabha that while the number of counter-terror actions initiated by security forces in Jammu & Kashmir had gone up by 59% during the first half of 2019 as compared to the corresponding period of 2018, the number of incidents initiated by terrorists declined by 28% over the same period.Stating that the government has adopted a policy of zero tolerance towards terrorism, minister of state for home G Kishan Reddy in reply to a question in Rajya Sabha said that the concerted and synergized efforts of security forces had led to an improvement in the security situation in the state this year.Between the Pulwama attack and now, 93 terrorists have been neutralised by the security forces. Investigation by NIA into the attack resulted in conspirators, suicide attacker and vehicle provider getting identified.
Further the operations on ground resulted in neutralisation of the conspirator, his associate and owner of the vehicle used in the attack that left 40 CRPF personnel dead.Until June this year, there were 261 terrorist attacks and 125 actions initiated by security forces in J&K. The fatalities suffered by the forces included 15 Army personnel, 48 CRPF personnel and 7 J&K police personnel.For the CRPF, the fatal casualties so far this year have far surpassed the numbers recorded in 2016 (11), 2017 (12) and 2018 (7).

28% Decline In Terrorist Incidents
Cross-border infiltration into Jammu & Kashmir fell by 43% in the first half of 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018, while terrorist incidents in the state declined by 28% and local recruitment of militants by 40% in the corresponding period, the government told Lok Sabha on Tuesday.
Minister of state for home G Kishan Reddy, responding to a question on whether infiltration in J&K had declined in the wake of the 'surgical strike' (a reference to the Balakot strikes undertaken in February), informed the House, "Due to concerted and synergised efforts of security forces, the security situation in the state has witnessed an improvement in the first half of this year over the corresponding period of 2018. Net infiltration has reduced by 43%." While Reddy refrained from linking the reduced infiltration to the Balakot strikes, inputs with intelligence agencies suggest that Pakistan-based terrorist outfits have, post the air strikes, got their fighters to abandon launchpads in PoK and instead shift to the western border with Afghanistan. This is the stretch where the United States forces have deployed drones to detect and eliminate terrorists.

India rejects UN report on rights abuse in Kashmir
Rahul Singh

Copyright 2019. HT Media Limited. All rights reserved.
New Delhi, July 9 -- India on Monday rejected a United Nations' report on human rights abuse in Jammu and Kashmir and lodged a strong protest against it, calling it "the continuation of the earlier false and motivated narrative" on the situation in the border state.
In an "Update of the Situation of Human Rights in Indian-administered Kashmir and Pakistan-administered Kashmir from May 2018 to April 2019", the Office of the High Commission for Human Rights (OHCHR) highlighted "serious human rights violations and patterns of impunity in Indian-administered Kashmir".
It also underlined significant human rights concerns in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.
Reacting to the 43-page report, ministry of external affairs spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said, "Its (the report's) assertions are in violation of India's sovereignty and territorial integrity and ignore the core issue of crossborder terrorism."
His comments are in line with India's rejection of the OHCHR'S first report, released in June 2018, on human rights abuse in the state. Last year's report focused on allegations of human rights violations, excessive use of force by Indian security forces causing civilian casualties, arbitrary detention and impunity for human rights.
"The Update seems to be a contrived effort to create an artificial parity between the world's largest and the most vibrant democracy and a country that openly practises state-sponsored terrorism," he said. Kumar said it was a matter of deep concern that the update seemed to give legitimacy to terrorism that was in complete variance with UN Security Council positions. India has lodged a strong protest regarding the Update with the OHCHR, he said.
The UN body asked the Indian authorities to respect human rights in Jammu and Kashmir, urgently repeal the Armed Forces Special Powers Act, [and, in the meantime, immediately remove the requirement for prior central government permission to prosecute security forces personnel accused of human rights violations in civilian courts] and set up impartial and credible investigations to probe all civilian killings which have occurred since July 2016, the year Burhan Wani was killed.
Wani, once a poster boy of militancy in the Valley, was killed in a gun battle with security forces on July 8, 2016, in Kokernag area of south Kashmir's Anantnag district. Wani's killing was marked by widespread violence in Kashmir for about four months.
The UN body asked India to provide rehabilitation to all individuals injured and the family of those killed in security operations and probe and prosecute all cases of sexual violence allegedly perpetrated by state and nonstate actors.
Kumar said the UNSC had in February 2019 condemned the Pulwama terror attack, in which 40 Central Reserve Police Force troopers lost their lives and subsequently proscribed Masood Azhar, the self-styled leader of terrorist entity Jaish-e-mohammed. "However, in the update, terrorist leaders and organisations sanctioned by the UN are deliberately underplayed as "armed groups", he added.

NEW DELHI, July 8 -- There is a "crisis of leadership and resources" among militants in Jammu and Kashmir and the security forces kept the ultras under check, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said in Rajya Sabha on Monday.
Replying to supplementaries during the Question Hour, the minister said an NIA probe is on into the February 14 Pulwama terror attack.
"Once the probe is over, only then can an answer in this regard be given by the Home Ministry," he informed the House after members asked if there was any intelligence or security lapse in the suicide attack in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed.
"In Jammu and Kashmir, our security forces are maintaining best coordination between the army, central armed forces, JK Police and intelligence. The security forces have kept a check on their activities. I want to tell you that as of now, there is a crisis of leadership and resources among the terrorists," Rajnath told Rajya Sabha.
He said the fatal casualties suffered by army personnel during terrorist attacks/tactical action in 2018 were 12, while the same were 13 in 2017 and six in 2016.
The minister said there are four types of casualties in the army - infiltration bids eliminated, counter terrorist operations, terrorist initiated incidents and tactical actions.
He said the casualties he mentioned earlier pertained to tactical actions and total casualties in other activities could be more.
"All the forward posts are adequately strengthened to withstand terrorist attacks. Continuous improvements, including the use of modern technology, in the defences are
made to make them more robust and resilient.
"The Army also carries out indepth analysis of terrorist incidents and security breaches that are identified with various incidents," Rajnath Singh said in his written reply.
In reply to another question on the total fatalities of armed personnel at higher altitudes including Siachen glacier, he said there have been eight such deaths in 2018, five in 2017 and 20 in 2016. "Causes of death in Siachen Glacier and other Super High Altitude Areas range from those directly related to High Altitude like High Altitude Pulmonary Oedama (HAPO) and Pulmonary Thrombo Embolism (PTE) to other general causes," he said in his written reply.
He said the Indian army is deployed in highly treacherous terrain along the borders in J&K, where there is constant threat of crevasses, avalanches and other weather related calamities to the troops.
Government undertakes several steps to prevent casualties like pre-induction medical examination, stringent acclimatization schedule, provision of specialised training, special living shelters, provision of specialised clothing and high quality rations, the minister said.
Steps are also undertaken to utilise modern technological equipment for rescue missions and prevention of accidents, apart from issuing of regular advisories, the minister said
Defence Minister also informed Rajya Sabha that the shortage of bullet-proof jackets for armed forces was being met through procurement of 1.86 lakh such jackets by April 2020 for nearly Rs 639 Cr.
Replying to supplementaries, the minister said there was no embargo on the import of raw material from China for making such bullet-proof jackets, and any supplier violating the tender norms would face action and could be disqualified.
The minister also assured the House that the government has no plans to reduce the justified benefits provided to armed personnel with disabilities. "In 2009, there was a shortage of 3,53,755 bullet proof jackets in the country, but procurement was not done for a long time. An RFP for procurement of 1,86,138 bullet proof jackets has been issued in April 2016 and the tender in this regard was allotted on April 9, 2018 to an Indian buyer. The total value of the contract is for Rs 638.97 crore, for procurement of 1,86,138 bullet proof jackets, which will be supplied within 36 months and it has to be completed by April 8, 2020," the minister told the house.
"So far, the DGQA quality checks have been completed and 10,000 bullet proof jackets have already been procured and a total of 37,000 such jackets have to be procured by this year, by 8.10.2019," he said.
Singh said Taiwan and China are included in the list of countries for import of synthetic fibre. "The source of raw material has not been listed in the tender for procurement of bullet-proof jackets. "There is no embargo on the import of raw material for bullet proof jackets from China in the tender. There is a clause for 30 per cent indigenous content from within India that has to be ensured," he said.
"There is no decline in the quality of bullet-proof jackets (BPJs) procured for the Indian Army," the minister said in his written reply. He said as bullet-proof jackets are protection equipment, these are procured strictly on the basis of General Staff Qualitative Requirement (GSQR) identified by the Service Headquarter with full Quality Assurance (QA) cover including detailed testing, provided by Director General of Quality Assurance (DGQA) for every lot/batch supplied by the vendor.
"Supply order for procurement of 50,000 BPJs to meet the immediate requirement was placed on 31.03.2016 on M/s Tata Advance Material Limited, Bangalore, 10, Jigani Industrial Area, Bangalore-560105. "These BPJs were delivered after quality inspection andacceptance in March, 2017.
"Contract for 1,86,138 BPJs was signed on 09 April 2018 with M/s SMPP Private Limited, M-17, South Extension, Part-II, New Delhi-110049. Quantity 10,000 BPJs have been delivered in March 2019 after usual quality inspection and acceptance," the minister told the house.
To a question on the benefits accorded to persons with disabilities, Singh said, "I want to make it clear to the House that the justified benefits to armed personnel with disabilities would not be reduced." He, however, said a clarification will be sought from the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) with regard to a recent circular.

Hurriyat cannot dictate terms on talks: Madhav
KT NEWS SERVICE.

© 2019. Kashmir Times
Jammu, July 8 -- BJP national general secretary Ram Madhav Monday said the Hurriyat Conference cannot dictate terms on talks with the Centre and asserted that those "supporting terrorism and separatism would not be entertained by the government."
With regard to assembly polls in J&K, he stated that Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was fully prepared for the polls and was awaiting the decision of Election Commission.
While addressing media after welcoming a prominent Congress leader Iqbal Malik from Darhal, Rajouri besides other in the party fold, Madhav also reiterated his party's resolve to abrogate Article 370 and Article 35A of the Constitution, which grant special status to the state, while expressing hope that the BJP would form the next government in the state with the help of "its friends." BJP national general secretary brushed aside the criticism of former Chief Ministers Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti on Highway restrictions in the wake of Amarnath Yatra stating that they were necessary to ensure security of pilgrims.
Replying to a question about PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti advocating dialogue with the Hurriyat, Madhav said, "The Hurriyat is not in a position to dictate to the government of India when to hold talks or when not to." He said the then Home Minister Rajnath Singh had made an offer to them to talk about two years ago and Dineshwar Sharma was appointed as a special interlocutor for engaging all sections of the people of the Kashmir valley. "At that time, the Hurriyat was not willing to come forward to talk. They cannot decide and dictate terms, time and everything to the Government of India," he said.
"As far as we are concerned, it is the prerogative and decision of the Union Home Ministry. Those who are against the constitution of India and those who are in support of terrorists and propagate separatism shall not be entertained. That is the view of our party," Madhav said.
On abrogation of Article 370 and 35-A, he said, "You all know the BJP's ideological stand on these articles. It is clear that we want these to be abrogated." "The process to do away with these articles will be set in motion. The Supreme Court is already hearing a petition on Article 35A, which was inserted in the constitutions illegally and is expected to take a decision on its revocation," he said. "The decision of the Court is still pending but modalities can be looked into how it can be revoked. One thing is clear that these are "illegal" and has to go from J&K," he said.
Madhav said the Centre was focused on ensuring equitable development of Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh regions and wiping out terrorism with strong hand. He said the government would take appropriate action against those supporting terrorism through overground activities, whether it is the Hurriyat, the JKLF or any other outfit. "We are happy that the centre and state administration is taking stern action in this direction," he said.
The BJP leader also defended the partial restriction on the movement of civilian traffic on the Jammu-Srinagar National Highway, saying the administration took this step to ensure smooth conduct of the Amarnath Yatra. He appealed to mainstream political parties to extend their support to the governor's administration to ensure peaceful conclusion of the 46-day yatra. The authorities have barred civilian traffic on the Qazigund-Nashri stretch of the highway for five-and-a-half hours, from 10 AM to 3:30 PM, in order to allow incident-free passage to vehicles carrying Amarnath pilgrims.
The decision drew protests from the National Conference, PDP and CPI(M), besides other stakeholders, especially those affiliated with tourism industry.
Asked about ex-Chief Ministers Omar Abdullah's statement that imposing traffic restrictions for safe passage of pilgrims shows "incompetence and laziness" of the state administration, Madhav quipped, "We have seen a lot of incompetence on the part of Farooq Abdullah and Omar Abdullah governments in the past." "It is no incompetency," he said. "It is a very competent way of ensuring peaceful and successful completion of the yatra. Better for all these leaders that rather than criticising the government and accusing the administration, they help the administration and the government in successful completion of the yatra," he said. "I am sure Mehbooba Mufti and her people will also help the administration in allowing the yatra peacefully."
To a question about assembly election in the state, Madhav said the BJP was hopeful of state polls taking place this year only after the successful conclusion of local bodies, panchayat and parliamentary elections. "We are for the assembly polls and are requesting the Election Commission to take a decision. We are fully prepared for the polls and are awaiting EC decision," he said. He said, "We have full faith that the people of the state will support the BJP which wants equitable development of all the three regions of the state." The BJP leader said Prime Minister Narendra Modi's policies and developmental pledge was attracting people, especially the minorities, towards the party. "We have also managed a strong presence in Kashmir where we won 200 sarpanch and panch seats and 100 Councillor seats in the local bodies and Panchayat elections. More people are coming forward and joining the party," he said.
With regard to Karnataka developments, he said that BJP had no involvement in the political crisis there. Madhav said that the current situation was due to infighting in the Congress-JD(S) coalition government. "'Ulta chor kotwal ko dante (It is a case of thief accusing the policeman). Whatever is happening in the Karnataka is happening because of the ambitions of certain leaders of their own party. There are leaders who are engineering dissent in their party. BJP has no involvement. We are just watching," he said when asked about the Congress blaming BJP for the political crisis in the state.
"The Congress-JD(S) coalition was against the wishes of people. Their infighting has created this issue," the BJP national general secretary added.

Security up in Valley ahead of Wani death anniversary

Copyright 2019. HT Media Limited. All rights reserved.
Srinagar, July 8 -- The authorities have beefed up security across Kashmir and suspended mobile internet services in the Valley's four southern districts ahead of militant commander Burhan Wani's third death anniversary on Monday.
Wani's killing in a firefight with security forces in South Kashmir's Bambodoora along with two other militants of home-grown militant group Hizbul Mujahideenon July 8, 2016 triggered protracted protests across the Valley that left over 100 people dead.
A tech-savvy militant, Wani used social media to spread his message. His killing followed an escalation in violence particularly in South Kashmir as more youths joined the militant ranks especially in four districts of South Kashmir - Pulwama, Shopian, Kulgam, and Anantnag.
Officials said high-level security arrangements will being put in place and additional troops deployed at sensitive places especially in South Kashmir on Monday in view of the strike call separatists have given to mark Wani's death anniversary.
A police officer said they have been advised to remain on alert and take all the precautions to maintain law and order.
In a statement, the separatist Joint Resistance Leadership asked people to observe complete shutdown on Monday to mark Wani's third death anniversary.
"Our youth have been forced to take extreme steps when their peaceful cries and democratic posturing was responded with brute and unmatched force,'' it said.
"Unending curbs on political activities, continuous detention of resistance leadership, denial of basic human values has added to the already existing political uncertainty in state and as such our youths are quite disheartened with the prevailing situation."
An official said the internet services were suspended as a precautionary measure to maintain law and order amid apprehensions of trouble.
"The mobile internet was suspended in South Kashmir early in the morning a day before the death anniversary of Burhan Wani. It will be only restored on Tuesday if the situation will remain peaceful,'' said Showkat Ahmad, a resident of South Kashmir's Pulwama town.

Government makes concerted bid to change ‘fake’ perception of Valley

NEW DELHI: The government seems to be making a concerted bid to counter the “fake” narrative of Jammu & Kashmir being on the boil when the insurgency has been confined to a smaller belt accounting for just 11% of the Kashmir valley.A recent assessment done by officials shows if the entire state’s geographical area, including Jammu and Ladakh regions, are added, the area where terrorists continue to pose a security challenge shrinks to a mere 3% of the area of the state.The home ministry under Amit Shah has decided to challenge the perception which has hurt the state by adversely impacting tourism- the mainstay of local economy- and has generated a negativity about the state in other parts: something which feeds into the estrangement and is exploited by Pakistan-backed secessionists to inflame passions.“The four districts in South Kashmir including Pulwama, Shopian, Anantnag and Kulgam, have witnessed some activity by insurgents but rest of the state has been peaceful,” a senior home
ministry official said adding, “Unfortunately, a picture is depicted as if the entire state is disturbed.”Sources said several delegations will be sent to the valley to see as to how the state is witnessing change and normalcy restored in most areas that will help people shed their apprehensions about visiting the tourist state.“We intend to convince people of the country particularly media that parts of Kashmir has a law and order problem and the state should not be given a special attention,” a top government functionary said. He said Pulwama terror attack resulted in sudden dip in tourist footfall but gradually it has regained momentum as most of the tourist destinations are witnessing reasonable occupancy.State Houseboat Association president Shamir Shah says negative image of the state is taking toll on tourism. “Not a single tourist has been attacked but negative media coverage about the state has harmed Kashmir the most,” he said and added, “Boost to tourism will be the best way to win people’s confidence.”Recently Congress leader in Rajya Sabha Gulam Nabi Azad had demanded that the government should ban giving negative publicity to the state, but the home minister was not in favour of imposing any ban. However, the government is making efforts to convince the media that ground reality should be shown unlike the current perception.While attempts to change perception about the state is intended to give boost to tourism, the government has also chalked out a comprehensive plan of action to reach out to the people of the valley with several centrally sponsored schemes.“Our effort is to ensure that at least nine lakh people of the valley are beneficiaries of one of the 16 centrally sponsored schemes,” a senior official said.

RDX, ammonium nitrate used in Pulwama attack, says forensic experts
Neeraj Chauhan

Copyright 2019. HT Media Limited. All rights reserved.
New Delhi, July 5 -- Four and half months after the deadly attack on a Central Reserve Police Force convoy in Kashmir's Pulwama district, in which 40 troopers were killed, forensic experts have finally submitted their report on the explosives used by the Jaish-e-Mohammad in the high-intensity bomb, according to two senior officials in the National Investigation Agency (NIA).
Experts of the Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) in Delhi, which functions under the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), has concluded that the explosive used in the February 14 suicide bombing was a mixture of "RDX" and "ammonium nitrate", which was assembled in a jerry can before it was placed in a Maruti Eeco car.
An NIA officer who asked not to be named said: "We have received the final report. It will be the most important (piece of) evidence in the charge sheet, which will be filed soon".
Based on the forensic report, the investigators believe that the RDX was mixed by JeM in the bomb to multiply the impact of the blast.
The second NIA officer, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said the impact was so strong that everything melted. The explosion was heard by locals several kilometers away and it took forensic experts days to pick the DNA samples from the site.
Indian intelligence agencies told investigators right away that military grade RDX was used and that this explosive was provided to terror outfits by the Pakistani military. They also suggested that the explosive was brought to India in different tranches in the months leading up to the attack.
When asked about the quantity of explosive used in the bomb, the second officer said it is usually guesswork in such explosions, but that be believes 30 to 50 kg of explosives were planted in the jerry can.
Aadil Ahmad Dar, a JeM terrorist from Kashmir, carried out the suicide bombing on February 14 when he drove the car laden with high intensity explosives into the convoy.
The Indian government retaliated for the attack by launching an air strike on a JeM training camp in Pakistan's Balakot area following which the two countries came to the brink of war.
It was only after the Pulwama attack that China was forced to support India's case for declaring JeM chief Maulana Masood Azhar a UN-designated global terrorist.
Meanwhile, the government, according to a senior ministry of home affairs official, has expressed its unhappiness over forensic experts taking so much time in finalising the report in such a sensitive case.

A draconian colonial legacy
Kashmir Times.

English
© 2019. Kashmir Times
Jammu, July 5 -- The Centre's decision to not scrap the draconian sedition law of colonial legacy is regressive one. That the union government is using the pretext of using sedition aw "to effectively combat anti-national, secessionist and terrorist elements", as stated by Minister of State for Home Affairs Nityanand Rai in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday as a justification for continuation of the statute is even more worrying. The law, whose origins lay in the bid to crush the Indian national freedom movement during the reign of the British colonial powers, has been grossly misused, post independence, in the last seven decades with the explicit aim to stifle dissent. The law is ambiguous enough to be invoked for pure vendetta or to silence any opposition and it severely militates against the constitutional guarantees of fundamental rights of the citizens, particularly freedom of expression.
The constitutional validity of sedition law rests upon either an intention to create public disorder or incitement of violence. However, governments have wrongly used the law to stonewall dissent or as a vindictive tool against adversaries. While successive government have used the sedition laws for political benefits, its brazen abuse since the rise of the BJP has been an even bigger cause for concern. 47 cases of sedition were filed in 2014 alone and 58 persons arrested. A cursory look at some of the sedition cases that were slapped from time to time during Modi led BJP's previous tenure in power is enough to demonstrate this point. In 2016, JNU students were charged of students for anti-India slogans raised on campus. Shortly afterwards, a petition against Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi for supporting the agitating JNU students was filed in Hyderabad. Later that year, Amnesty International was charged with sedition for organising a programme with victims of human rights abuse from Kashmir speaking to an audience in Bangalore. A Kashmiri youth in Chattisgarh stands charged of sedition for liking a facebook post and leading Kannada actress Ramya was even more bizarrely charged of sedition for saying "Pakistan is not hell" while opposing union defence minister for indulging in bellicose rhetoric. Before that in 2015, BJP led Maharashtra government came out with an official circular official circular that gave the government sweeping powers to clamp down on all critics with sedition charges, a draconian order that was rightly struck down by the Maharashtra high-court with the observations that the circular implied that everybody in the opposition can be put behind bars. The government's decision to use the law as part of counter-terrorism strategy raises similar concerns as there are genuine fears of targeting one community. The ambiguity of the law can alternatively be misused to go soft on others. It may not be without design that sedition law has been invoked in the Bulandshahr violence of last year and killing of a cop who tried to stop mob lynching even though there are clearly defined laws to put the accused on a fair trial.
It is against the concept to liberal democracy to press sedition charges solely for expressing hatred, contempt or ill-will against the government of the day. If such remarks and actions provoke and promote violence and riots, there are other existing laws within the Indian constitution that can be invoked. This makes the very existence of sedition law defined under Article 124-A redundant. That is why, it needs to be dispensed with lock, stock and barrel. Unfortunately, as part of its saffron project, sedition is a tool propped up with liberal doses of ultra-nationalistic discourse to clampdown on all forms of dissent and thus undermine democratic ethos and democratic norms. The existence and application of law through it brazen misuse are both a threat to democracy and that is why the issue calls for serious introspection and steps to dispense with the law. Archaic and draconian laws which have an imperial legacy must be scrapped through legislation in the parliament. Till that time, certain steps need to be taken to ensure that the law is not used to victimise people and to safeguard the constitutional right of freedom of speech.

Supreme Court upholds soldier’s dismissal for ‘cowardice’ during action
Dhananjay Mahapatra

(c) 2019 The Times of India Group
NEW DELHI: Upping the bar of bravery for soldiers, the Supreme Court upheld the dismissal of an Army man for showing cowardice during anti-terrorist operations in Jammu & Kashmir in 2006 while brushing aside his colleagues’ testimony that he was a good soldier who had taken part in similar operations in the past and was diligent in protecting the border.“A soldier cannot live merely on past glory but should rise to the occasion on every occasion to defend the integrity of the nation since such is the trust reposed in a soldier,” said a bench of Justices M R Shah and A S Bopanna.
The bench upheld the soldier’s dismissal for showing cowardice during the anti-terrorist operation, but set aside the six-month imprisonment imposed by the Summary General Court Martial (SGCM).A court martial had found the soldier guilty of abandoning his duty and not retaliating despite being armed with an AK-47 assault rifle and a pistol when terrorists opened fire on the position of an Army team that had surrounded the ultras in a maize field near village Darigidiyan in J&K. The terrorists killed Sapper Gurmail Singh and took away a light machine gun.In his defence, the soldier had said he had jumped a nearby wall to protect himself and lost consciousness for 10-15 seconds after he was hit by a bullet in his leg. He said in those 10-15 seconds, when he was unconscious, the terrorists took away the LMG. He also claimed that his AK-47 had got jammed.The SC said the soldier did not rise to the occasion, more particularly when his colleague was attacked and killed. Writing the judgment for the bench, Justice Bopanna said, “There is no reasonable explanation as to why he had not used the weapons which were with him when the attack from the militants had already taken place and his colleague was injured.” It refused to accept the soldier’s alibi that he was unconscious briefly during the operation and said it was belied by the fact that he had narrated minute details of the operation.The court was conscious that in service matters, past conduct would be relevant to decide the proportionality of the punishment. However, it said, “The court should be cautious while considering the case of an officer/soldier/employee of a disciplined force and the same yardstick of sympathetic consideration as in other cases can’t be applied.

Pak books Hafiz Saeed, 12 others for terror funding

Jammu, July 4 -- Pakistani authorities on Wednesday booked 26/11 Mumbai attack mastermind Hafiz Saeed and his 12 accomplices for terror funding in 23 cases, amidst growing international pressure on Islamabad to act against militant groups.
Pakistan counter-terrorism department said it has registered 23 cases against the chief of the Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) and 12 aides for using five trusts to "raise funds for terrorism financing".
The Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) of Pakistan's Punjab province filed cases against Jamat-ud-Dawa (JuD) chief Hafiz Saeed and other members of his organisation. This comes after Punjab CTD launched second phase of crackdown against banned outfits, operating in the Punjab province.
The cases have been registered under the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA). The charity organisations listed in the cases are Dawat Irshad Trust, Moaz Bin Jabal Trust, Al-Anfaal Trust, Al-Madina Foudation Trust and Al-Hamd Trust.
The organisations have been operating in major cities including Lahore, Gujranwala and Multan. At least four main members of Jamat-ud-Dawa (JUD) have been nominated in the cases including Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, Abdul Rehman Makki (brother-in-law of Hafiz Saeed), Ameer Hamza, and Mohammad Yahya Aziz.
Details of the cases reveal that these individuals have been involved in raising funds to facilitate terror activities.
Operating under the umbrella of charities, these organisations have been funneling funds to terror suspects and promoting terrorism.
It is pertinent to note that Pakistan government imposed a ban on Jamat-ud-Dawa (JuD) and its charity front Falah-e-Insaniyat Foundation (FIF), after enlisting them in its list of banned outfits.
The move was in live with United Nation (UN) list of banned outfits and individuals, which has had these organisations and individuals in its blacklist for some time.
JuD Chief Hafiz Saeed is accused of masterminding the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks with a 10 million dollar bounty on his head, sanctioned by the United States.

Jammu, July 3 -- A total of 119 militants were killed so far this year in Jammu and Kashmir by security forces, which also lost 24 personnel, Rajya Sabha was informed on Wednesday.
Earlier in the Lok Sabha, the Centre informed that the security forces killed 800 militants since 2014, of which 249 were in 2018.
Union Minister of State for Home G Kishan Reddy in Rajya Sabha said that 252 militants were killed in Jammu and Kashmir in 2018 when 44 security personnel lost their lives.
Till June 26 this year, 119 terrorists were killed in the state, he said in written reply to a question. Twenty-four security personnel lost their lives during the period.
Replying to another question, Reddy said the number of misguided local youths joining militancy has shown a declining trend during the current year.
In 2017 and 2018, the numbers of foreign militants neutralised were more than local militants, he said.
In a written response to a question in the Lok Sabha, Minister of State in the Defence Ministry Shripad Naik said the security forces killed 800 militants since 2014, of which 249 were in 2018.
He said 104 militants were killed in 2014, 97 in 2015, 140 in 2016 and 210 in 2017.
"The security forces are combating the terrorists' activities, both along the Line of Control by eliminating the infiltration bids and in hinterland by carrying out counter-terrorist operations and responding to terrorist-initiated incidents," Naik said.
The minister said sustained operations conducted by the security forces "have resulted in (the) elimination of (a) large number of terrorists."
Replying to a separate question, Naik said firm and decisive response was given by the army to the ceasefire violations on the India-Pakistan border.
In March, April and May, he said 267, 234, 221 cases of ceasefire violations were reported, respectively.
In a response to another question on whether the United States had approved the sale of armed drones to India, Naik said, "This is a continuous process undertaken through procurement from various indigenous as well as foreign sources. Highest priority is accorded to optimally equip the armed forces and keep them in a state of readiness."
Based on threat assessment and security imperatives, the minister said, "The government constantly reviews the national security scenario and takes steps to induct appropriate defence equipment to meet the security challenges and operational requirements."

New Delhi,NATIONAL Anees-ul-Islam’s father was arrested in case last year The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has summoned the grandson of separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani for questioning in the 2017 terror financing case, a senior official said.
The NIA sent a notice to Anees-ul-Islam, son of Mr. Geelani’s daughter, on Tuesday, asking him to appear at its Delhi office on July 9. Mr. Islam, who holds a Master’s in Business Administration, is working as a researcher with the Sher-i-Kashmir International Convention in Srinagar.
His appointment in 2016 during the tenure of chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti raised eyebrows, with National Conference vice-president Omar Abdullah questioning the decision. Mr. Islam’s father, Altaf Shah, alias ‘Fantoosh’, was arrested last year in the terror funding case and has been in Tihar jail since.
Editor questioned
The NIA also questioned the editor-in-chief of a prominent English daily from Kashmir for the second consecutive day on Tuesday in connection with the case.
The journalist was being questioned on reports in his paper during the 2016 agitation that followed the death of Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani in an encounter. He was also being quizzed about his visit to Dubai.
Earlier, Mr. Geelani’s sons and Hurriyat Conference chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq were also summoned by the NIA.
The NIA case, registered on May 30, 2017 against the separatist and secessionist leaders, mentions raising, receiving and collecting funds through various illegal means, including hawala, for funding separatist and terrorist activities in Jammu and Kashmir and for causing disruption in the Kashmir valley.

Civilian killings in 'militancy-free' Baramulla throw officials in a tizzy

Srinagar, July 3 -- Five months after Baramulla was declared as the first police district in the Valley that no longer had any militant, the killing of two civilians by suspected militants in the strategic north Kashmir district in last three months has sound an alarm bell as militants have become active in the district after remaining off the gaze.
After the killing of three local Lashkar militants--Shuiab Akhoon, Mohsin Mushtaq and Nisar Darzi--in January, the J&K police had declared the strategic police district of north Kashmir free from militancy, the first district in Kashmir with no surviving militant.
The trio was gunned down at Binner village on the outskirts of the town in an encounter.Officials, however admitted that militants have started focussing on Baramulla town again.
"The militants do come to the town but due to security pressure they don't stay here for many days. They remain in the town for a brief time,'' said an officer adding that civilian killings in the area has alarmed officials.
On Sunday evening, a 25-year-old youth Sameer Ahmad Ahangar of Chesti Colony was shot at by unidentified gunmen. The injured was shifted to Baramulla Medical College hospital and later referred to Sher- e- Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences (SKIMS) where he succumbed to his injuries late Sunday night.
SKIMS medical superintendent Dr Farooq Jan confirmed the death.
"Ahangar had received multiple injuries in thigh and abdomen. He had succumbed late night."
Ahangar is the second civilian who was killed in the town in last three months. Earlier on March 30, a 35-year-old chemist Arjamand Majeed Bhat was shot dead by unidentified gunmen inside his medical shop in the main market of the town.
The local recruitment has also started to crawl its way back into the town lately. Though the numbers are less in comparison to south Kashmir, the trend seems alarming. Since Bhat's killings, two youths--Adnan Ahmad Channa from Arampora locality of the main town andJunaid Farooq of Hamray Pattan, who was pursuing post graduation course in Urdu--had joined the militant ranks. While Channa has joined Lashkar, Farooq has got affiliated with Hizbul Mujahideen.
"Though the recruitment has largely been happening in south Kashmir, the joining of two youths from a district that was militancy-free is a cause for concern," a security officer in Srinagar had said.
Baramulla is a strategic district with the headquarters of army's 19 Infantry Division which overlooks the Line of Control (LoC) in Uri, Gulmarg and Nowgam in North Kashmir. The Baramulla is also the district where separatists have good support base especially in the old Baramulla town which was once a hub of local militants.
"It was bound to happen. Baramulla is located close to LoC and also adjacent to those areas where militants are present. So once the area was declared militancy-free by police, the militants started focussing on the town and its adjacent areas," said Javeed Ahmad, who teaches at a government college in north Kashmir.
A senior police officer, however, ruled out that it could be come back of militancy.

Their kids study abroad, separatists call for school and college bandhs in Kashmir: Amit Shah
Dipak K Dash

The Times of India
TOI

NEW DELHI: Promising a fitting reply to elements calling for a "break-up" of India, home minister Amit Shah on Monday said the children of as many as 130 separatist leaders in Kashmir are studying or have studied abroad even as these leaders issue calls to shut down schools and colleges in the valley.Shah said separatists have no qualms over inciting Kashmiri youth to stone-pelting and warned that they will receive no quarter even as he emphasised that the Centre has worked to re-open schools and health facilities under President's rule. "We will win hearts of people in Kashmir… They will embrace us," he said while replying to a debate in Rajya Sabha on a resolution to extend President's rule by six months.The Upper House unanimously approved extension of President's Rule and the Jammu and Kashmir (Reservation) Amendment Bill to provide quota benefits to persons residing in areas adjoining international border- just those who live adjoining Line of Control (LoC).
The Lok Sabha has passed both bills.While stating that those working against India "will be given an appropriate response in their language" Shah underscored that the government's commitment to the policy of 'Jamhooriyat, Insaniyat, Kashmiriyat' should not be taken to mean that the forces who want to divide India will be spared.The home minister also responded to the divisive debate over Jawaharlal Nehru and decisions on Jammu and Kashmir, saying that while he did want to lower the prestige of India's first Prime Minister, but history would treat the post-Independence blunders very harshly.He stressed that a country that doesn't learn from its mistakes doesn't end up too well. He also insisted that faulting Nehru's decisions did not imply that he was questioning his intentions. "Congress must answer for the historical blunders done by them: Why did Nehru government go to the UN despite Kashmir's accession to India? Why did he agree for a plebiscite that is in any case out of question today?" he asked."How many schools have been shut down and burnt; teachers killed and studies discontinued at schools in the name of boycott... There is one leader whose son has studied and is working at a salary of Rs 30 lakh per month in Saudi Arabia. Another leader's son has studied in London and is now a doctor in Saudi Arabia. Two sons of Asiya Andrabi (arrested separatist leader in J&K terror funding case) have studied abroad and her third son is pursuing higher education in Malaysia and here she says school should remain shut," Shah said.The home minister appealed Kashmiri youth to see through the design of such people who are trying to mislead them. "Please check that their own children are studying abroad and are living a good life there. Don't get misled and take to stone-pelting," he said.Shah's tough talk comes amid reports of separatists leaders are keen to hold talks with the government and should indicate that the government is in no mood to engage with the Hurriyat at present. The home minister said that the traditional approach to resolve the Kashmir issue has not worked and there was a need for a fresh approach where no region - Jammu and Ladakh - gets left behind. He also cited how government has cracked down on terror funding and there has been 40 arrests and 137 challans in such cases.Responding to charges of opposition that government was bypassing scrutiny of Bills by parliamentary panels, Shah cited that during UPA-I, 207 out of 248 bills introduced in Parliament did not go to any parliamentary panel and during UPA-II their number was 125 out of total 180 Bills. He said, in contrast, 124 out of the 180 bills introduced during Modi 1.0 were referred to these committees.

How did Amarnath Yatra become the government’s concern?
413 words
3 July 2019
The Times of India
TOI
English
(c) 2019 The Times of India Group
Not any yatra: Over 1 lakh pilgrims will be making the annual pilgrimage to the 3,880 metre-high cave shrine of Amarnath starting today and keeping an eye will be a posse of over 40,000 armed CRPF and state police personnel. The security threat to the yatra is one of the reasons home minister Amit Shah made his first trip to Jammu and Kashmir since assuming office this week.Vote for yatra: The successful completion of the yatra is important for another reason - it could pave the way for Jammu and Kashmir to vote in a new assembly later this year. The state was put under President's rule on December 19 last year following six months of Governor's rule after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) pulled out of the People's Democratic Party-led coalition government in June 2018.
Earlier this month, the Election Commission said that it would take a call on elections in the state after assessing the situation following the Amarnath Yatra.State and pilgrims: Amarnath cave is said to have been rediscovered by a Muslim shepherd, Buta Malik, in 1850. Malik's family were custodians of the shrine along with Hindu priests from Dashnami Akhara and Purohit Sabha Mattan till 2000. Shri Amarnath Shrine Board Act was passed by the J&K Assembly in 2000-01 and a shrine board with the state's governor as chairman was formed. The board became the custodian of the shrine in order to streamline the pilgrimage and improve facilities for pilgrims.Terror and pilgrimage: Between 1990 and 2017, there have been 36 terror attacks on the yatra in which 53 pilgrims have died and 167 injured. The two major ones occurred in 2000 and 2017. In 2000, 25 people (including 17 pilgrims) died in a militant attack in Pahalgam, while in 2017, 8 pilgrims were killed and 19 injured in a terror attack at Botengro in southern Anantnag. In fact, the yatra did not take place from 1991 to 1995 because of terror threats. The terror threat is high given the recent terrorist attack in Pulwama when an explosives laden vehicle rammed into a CRPF bus killing 40 soldiers. Around 115 terrorists have been killed by security forces so far this year in comparison to 257 last year. There are still close to 290 terrorists currently active in J&K, say security agencies.

NEW DELHI, June 29 -- Home minister Amit Shah said on Friday that assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) will be held as soon as later this year, as he moved a statutory resolution in the Lok Sabha seeking an extension of President's Rule in the state for another six months, appealing MPs to rise above party lines and endorse the move.
The resolution was opposed by the Congress, the single largest opposition group in the Lok Sabha, which said President's rule had been the result of the short-lived alliance between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Mehbooba Mufti's People's Democratic Party (PDP), which it said were "incompatible" partners.
"This House approves the continuance in force of the Proclamation dated the 19th December 2018 in respect of the State of Jammu and Kashmir, issued under article 356 of the Constitution by the President, for a further period of six months with effect from July 3, 2019," the resolution read.
Restoring civilian rule and eliminating terrorism in the troubled state are the top priorities of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government, said Shah, who paid a two-day visit to J&K this week, his first since becoming home minister in the second term of the NDA government, sworn in on May 30.
"I want to state this clearly -- that restoring democracy is the top priority of the BJP-led government," said Shah, 54, who will also remain president of the BJP until the completion of organisational elections in January 2020, when he will hand over charge to the party's working president Jagat Prakash Nadda, "We are committed to eliminating terrorism from its roots in the state".
J&K has been under direct federal rule, administered by the governor, since the BJP in June 2018 walked out of a coalition government led by Mufti, complaining about increasing radicalisation and violence in the Kashmir Valley. Mufti quit as chief minister immediately; the state assembly was dissolved in November when the PDP, supported by the Congress and arch rival National Conference, staked claim to forming a new government..
On June 12, the Union cabinet approved the extension of President's Rule in J&K for six months. The present term of President's rule in the state is expiring on July 2.
Shah said it was essential for President's Rule to be extended for another six months with effect from July 3, given the fact that the Election Commission had decided to hold fresh elections in the state later this year.
"Assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir will be held at the appropriate time and it is possible that it could be held by the end of this year," Shah told the Lok Sabha, saying the polls weren't possible now .
Shah said the law and order situation in J&K had improved under direct federal rule, citing Panchayat and Parliamentary elections that, he said. had been conducted without violence .
The government's "zero tolerance" policy, he said, had worked in hitting at the roots of terrorism.
The Congress opposed the resolution for extension of President's Rule.
"The roots of the reason for seeking six-month extension for President's rule in J&K lie in the incompatible government formed by the BJP and PDP alliance," the Congress's Manish Tiwari said.
"Situation in J&K worsened between 2015 and 2018 when the youth of the state took to the streets."
Tiwari said that it was not in India's interest to not have an elected government at the helm in J&K and asked why assembly polls hadn't been held simultaneously with the peaceful Lok Sabha elections in the state.
"If you have a tough policy against terrorism, we do not oppose it. But there is a need to keep in mind that the fight against terrorism can only be won if people are with you," Tiwari said.
Security forces in J&K have killed more than 120 militants in J&K so far this year in a stepped-up counter-terrorism drive.
To be sure, the security forces have suffered their share of fatalities, notably the 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) troopers who were killed in a February 14 suicide car bombing, which prompted India to launch air strikes on a terror camp in Pakistan's Balakot 12 days later.
Before Parliament convened for the day, the BJP issued a three-line whip to all its members in the Lok Sabha, asking them to be present in the House, signalling the importance it attached to the resolution.
In the House, Shah assured MPs that there will be no attempt by treasury benches to interrupt the discussion on the resolution to extend President's rule inJ&K and asked the Congress to reciprocate.
Shah also asked BJP MPs, who were commenting aloud on Tiwari's speech, to calm down.
The government separately moved the Jammu and Kashmir Reservation (Amendment) Bill, 2019, which seeks to extend to people living along the international border (IB) in J&K benefits of reservation in direct recruitment and promotions, and admission in professional courses on par with those offered to people living along the Line of Control (LoC).
Shah said that under the law, 43% reservation was offered by the state, 3% set apart for people living along the LoC. The bill provides to extend benefits under the 3% quota to people living along the international border.
The Congress's Tiwari said his party supported "the spirit" of the bill but was opposed to the "manner" in which it was being implemented. He said the bill should have been introduced in the J&K assembly instead.
Shah was in J&K this week to review security arrangements for the annual pilgrimage to the cave shrine of Amarnath besides taking stock of the overall situation.
On Friday, officials said the 45-day-long Yatra, which starts on July 1, will be conducted under the surveillance of closed circuit television cameras installed at vantage points. Barriers have been set up on highways, surprise vehicle checks are being conducted, and quick reaction security teams will be deployed, Kathua deputy commissioner Vikas Kundal told local journalists.

Engage with families of militants: Amit Shah to J&K administration
Sudhi Ranjan Sen

New Delhi, June 29 -- Home minister Amit Shah has asked the Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) administration to engage with the families of terrorists and militants, especially those killed in counter-terror operations, in an outreach aimed at building trust in the state.
In some cases, the idea is to also "bring the militants back to the mainstream," senior officials familiar with the plan said on condition of anonymity.
Shah also asked the J&K administration to name streets and roads after policemen killed in the line of duty. "The idea is to have local icons dominate the narrative," one of the officials cited above said, explaining the rationale. During his two-day trip to J&K this week, Shah visited the family of Arshan Khan, a police inspector killed in a terror attack in Anantnag on 12 June.
Counter-terror operations in the valley will intensify in the coming days, the officials added. And, although Shah told Parliament on Friday that elections in the Jammu and Kashmir would be held when the Election Commission decides, the security establishment is advising a more cautious approach.
Security agencies and forces, especially the Indian Army, are of the opinion that violence levels must come down even further before assembly elections in the state can be conducted, the officials said. Counter-terror operations have left at least 120 terrorist dead in the first six months of the year; 257 were killed in 2018.
Despite the success, security forces estimate there are around 250 active terrorists still operating in the valley. "The remaining terrorists must be put under sustained pressure, there should be no let-up in counter-terror operations," a second senior official added. The fact that local recruitmetnt has dipped to single digits as compared to nearly 200 in the last year has given hope to the security establishment that continued sustained operations will be "yield results" this person said.
In addition to sustained counter-terror operations, security forces also want the network of overground workers (OGW) - those who provide logistics and material support to terrorists - further weakened . In particular, security forces want the National Investigative Agency (NIA) to probe terror funding and prosecute people. "The OGW network must be dismantled completely," a third senior official in the security establishment said. "Pressure on the terror financing network because of arrests of key figures is showing. Stone-throwing, agitations, and the number of local youth joining the ranks have dropped."

Shah: J&K polls this year, no compromise on terror

NEW DELHI, June 29 -- The Lok Sabha on Friday passed a statutory resolution extending President's Rule in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) by six months after home minister Amit Shah, in his first major speech in the House, said assembly elections were likely to be held as early as the end of this year.
Shah also pledged to eliminate terrorism in the state and launched a frontal attack against the Congress for its handling of the state, which he claimed was responsible for many of today's problems.
The resolution was approved by a voice vote by the House together with the Jammu and Kashmir Reservation (Amendment) Bill, 2019, which seeks to extend to people living along the international border (IB) in J&K benefits of reservation in direct recruitment and promotions, and admission in professional courses on par with those offered to people living along the Line of Control (LoC).
Congress, the single largest opposition group in the Lok Sabha, firmly opposed the resolution.
Congress MP Manish Tewari said the current spell of President's rule has been the result of the short-lived alliance between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Mehbooba Mufti's People's Democratic Party (PDP), which he said were "incompatible" partners.
He then alleged that the typical Kashmiri's sense of alienation has increased under the BJP government. The home minister proceeded to blame the Congress for the situation in the state.
On the one hand, the Congress accuses the BJP of trampling on democracy in J&K, and, on the other, when it was in charge, it imposed Article 356 (President's rule) 93 times out of the 126 times it has been invoked in the state, Shah said.He added that the party's policies had driven a wedge between the people of J&K and the rest of India.
"Today one-third of Kashmir is not with us. Who announced ceasefire when Pakistan encroached in Kashmir after independence and occupied one-third of its territory?, " he said, referring to first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru.
"You say we don't take people into confidence, but Nehru ji did this without taking the then HM (Sardar Patel) into confidence. So Manish ji, don't teach us history," Shah said.
"If he had taken Patel into confidence before announcing a ceasefire, Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir would not be there and terrorism would not have existed in Kashmir," Shah said.
Restoring civilian rule and eliminating terrorism in the troubled state are the top priorities of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government, said Shah, who paid a two-day visit to J&K this week, his first since becoming home minister in the second term of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government, sworn in on May 30.
"I want to state this clearly -- that restoring democracy is the top priority of the BJP-led government," said Shah, 54, who will also remain president of the BJP until the completion of organisational elections in January 2020, when he will hand over charge to the party's working president Jagat Prakash Nadda, "We are committed to eliminating terrorism from its roots in the state".
Shah warned: "Those who want to break India should have fear in their hearts...they should be scared and their fear will increase further in the coming times."

SRINAGAR, June 29 -- A Pakistani Jaish-e-Mohammad militant was killed in a gunbattlewith security forces in Jammu and Kashmir's Budgam district on Friday, officials said.
The encounter began at Kralpora Checkpora in Central Kashmir after the Indian Army, police and CRPF launched a cordon and search operation in the area after receiving a tip-off about the presence of militants.
Police spokesman Manoj Kumar said the hiding militants fired at the search party and the fire was retaliated.
"In the ensuing encounter, a terrorist was killed and the body was retrieved from the encounter site. Arms and ammunition have also been recovered," he said. It was a clean operation as there was no collateral damage during the exchange of fire, said the official.
Kashmir police in a tweet later identified the militant as Zarar.
"From the incriminating materials recovered, the killed terrorist has been identified as (a) foreigner from Pakistan namely Zarar who was affiliated with proscribed terror outfit JeM," it said.
Police requested citizens not to venture near the encounter zonetill the area is completely sanitized and cleared of all the explosive materials if any.
This year, the security forces have so far killed 113 militants and their associates while 73 security force personnel have also been killed in retaliation including 40 CRPF jawans from February 14 Pulwama attack.

113 militants, 73 security men killed in J&K this year

SRINAGAR, June 29 -- The first six months of the year have been hectic for the security forces as operations against militants were launched almost on daily basis in four districts of South Kashmir which have more militants on ground, especially local militants.
Around 113 militants were killed in these operations while 73 security personnel lost their lives in militant attacks.
The intensity of these operations increased after the Lethpora blast, in which 40 Central Reserve Police Force were killed when a suicide bomber from a Pulwama village, Adil Dar, rammed his explosive-laden vehicle into the CRPF convoy.
The airstrikes at Balakot in Pakistan following the attack brought India and Pakistan at the brink of war, leading to rise in tensions in the border area.
Union home minister Amit Shah, while reviewing a high-level security meeting on Thursday, said there is a significant improvement in all parameters related to security in the state.
Almost ten commanders were killed in the operations in this year, which according to the officials were top recruiters to the militant groups. Officials said, around 45 to 50 youths have joined militant ranks so far, which is very less compared to past three years. Last year alone in June and July, more than 61 youths had joined the militant ranks. The silver lining for the officials is that 20 youths were brought back into the mainstream after joining the militant ranks. "For us, this year has been good as the operations were successful and recruitment came down. Even top commanders of Jaish, Lashkar, Ansar Ghazwat-Ul-Hind and IS were killed," a senior police officer told Hindustan Times. Despite apprehensions, the election to three Lok Sabha seats in Kashmir remained violence-free. "For us peaceful elections were very encouraging," a senior officer said.
After the Lethpora blast, the militants made at least three attempts to carry out attacks similar to Pulwama in Jammu and Kashmri. One such attempt of simulation was in Banihal, in which militant who triggered the blast was arrested. Another one was at Arihal village in Pulwama, where two soldiers were killed and seven others injured.
"The use of improvised explosive device (IEDs), which are fitted in cars, is a worrying trend. Recently, some youths were arrested who were planning to make IEDs. After many years, the militants are again trying to use IEDs and car bombs in Kashmir," said another officer privy to investigations.
A big worrying trend is that youths are still joining the militant ranks, posting their pictures with weapons and announcing joining militant ranks.More than 113 militants were killed in Kashmir but there were only one or two incidents which took place near the LoC indicating that there has been no major infiltration attempts from across the LoC this year, the army officials said.

PATNA: Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi on Thursday made an appeal to the parties opposing proposal to revoke Article 370 to change their stand following the massive mandate given to the NDA in the recently concluded Lok Sabha election.The Nitish Kumar-led JD(U) is also against abrogation of Article 370 granting autonomy to Jammu and Kashmir. The BJP, it may be recalled, had fought the Lok Sabha election promising strong stand against separatist forces and revocation of Article 370. “It is the result of arrest of separatist leaders in Jammu and Kashmir, withdrawal of their security cover and strict action on terror funding that no separatist outfit called for a bandh in the valley during the visit of Union home minister Amit Shah. This has happened for the first time in last 30 years,” Modi tweeted. Shah is on a two-day visit to Jammu and Kashmir from Wednesday.Nitish had opposed revocation of Article 370 even after Pulwama terror attacks. “Article 370 should not be abrogated.
We can never think about it. There is provision for Article 370 in the Constitution. It is important to keep Article 370 in place to stop terror activities. The stand of our party is clear on this issue,” Nitish had said in Patna on February 21.

Srinagar, June 28 -- An alleged militant of Jammu and Kashmir Islamic State (ISJK) has accused Hizbul Mujahideen (HM) and Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) of killing his associate Adil Das at Bijbehara in South Kashmir's Anantnag district.
In an eight minute video released on various social media platforms, ISJK militant Khateeb Das claimed that three militants of LeT and HM were involved in the killing of Adil Das.
Displaying the alleged pictures of the trio, he said his associate was cheated.
"The plan to kill Adil Das was made well in advance. The trio were the spies of HM and LeT. They fired at Adil and Turrab when they were offering prayers. Adil died on the spot while as Turrab managed to flee," he is seen saying in the purported video.
Apart from the video, the pictures of HM and LeT militants allegedly involved in Das's killing have been surfacing on the social media. However, the authenticity of the pictures could not be verified.
Pertinently, police in a statement issued on Thursday said that it recovered a body of active militant from the orchards of Bijbehara area in Anantnag district.
Police said another militant was arrested in injured condition by a joint team of police and security forces from the area.
Deputy Inspector General (DIG), South Kashmir Range, Atul Goel told The Kashmir Monitor that the person in the video is an active militant.
"Somebody has uploaded the video. As of now, we don't know who has uploaded it. He is a categorized militant, affiliated with ISJK. He was the accomplice of slain Adil Das," he said.

Blame game to escape responsibility for impasse: Tewari

NEW DELHI, June 28 -- The Indian National Congress on Friday accused the Modi government of diversionary tactics to escape responsibility for the present situation in Jammu and Kashmir.
The party also charged the government with taking recourse in history rather than admit that the alliance between the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Peoples Democratic Party and the policies of the present government were responsible for the situation.
Talking to reporters here, AICC spokesperson Manish Tewari said, "It is unfortunate that rather than coming up with answers for pertinent questions raised by the opposition, the government tried to deflate, obfuscate and escape from answers for the present situation in Jammu and Kashmir."
Earlier Tewari while initiating the discussion in the Lok Sabha on the Statutory Resolution for extension of the central rule in the state moved by Home Minister Amit Shah, opposed the extension of President's Rule in Jammu and Kashmir and blamed the "incompatible" alliance of BJP and PDP for the current security situation in the state.
"Today the situation is such that we have to extend the President's Rule in Jammu and Kashmir for every six months. Its roots are in the incompatible alliance of PDP and BJP in 2015," Tewari said. He claimed that the Congress handed Jammu and Kashmir to succeeding governments when the state was progressing and the situation worsened between 2015 and 2018. "If you have a tough policy against terrorism, we do not oppose it. But there is a need to keep in mind that the fight against terrorism can only be won if people are with you," Tewari said.
Slamming the Centre for not holding Assembly elections on time, the Congress leader said, "It is not in our country's interests to not have an elected government in Jammu and Kashmir. If Lok Sabha elections were held and went off peacefully, then why Assembly polls cannot be held there?"
Earlier while moving the resolution, Shah promised that Assembly elections will be held in by this year end. "This House approves the continuance in force of the Proclamation dated the 19th December 2018 in respect of the State of Jammu and Kashmir, issued under article 356 of the Constitution by the President, for a further period of six months with effect from July 3, 2019," the resolution said.
The present term of President's Rule in the state is expiring on July 2. The President's Rule was implemented in the state in June last year following the collapse of the PDP-BJP alliance.
The state assembly, initially kept in suspended animation was dissolved by Governor Satya Pal Malik in November. Tewari said an elected government in the state is in the interest of the nation and will help the Centre in its fight against terrorism. Alleging that the sense of alienation among the people of
Jammu and Kashmir has increased under the BJP government, Tewari blamed the BJP's alliance with the PDP for imposition of governor's rule in the state.
It is "not in the interest of people in the state and the country" that Governor's rule should continue in the state, the Congress leader said, adding, "An elected government in Jammu and Kashmir will help the Centre in its fight against terrorism there."
Maintaining that he and his party were not opposed to the Centre's fight against terrorism, he said, "Fight against terrorism cannot be won when people are not with you." Cautioning the government, Tewari said it should not take such steps which alienate the people of the state. The biggest mistake of the Modi government was that sense of alienation increased among people in the state, he said adding, "government needs to walk two extra miles to integrate them into the national stream."
Taking on the BJP, Tewari said if the party continues to look at Jammu and Kashmir with "its ideological blinkers," the problem of the state cannot be resolved.
On the question of Jammu and Kashmir reservation bill, Tewari said his party is not against the spirit of the bill, but actually it is the right of the state assembly as this proposed legislation comes under its jurisdiction.

Mob attacks by extremists

Jammu, June 28 -- A few days ago in Saraikela Kharsawan district of Jharkhand a 24 years old, Tabrez Ansari was lynched by a mob. He worked as a daily wager in Pune and was travelling to his village on June 19. The people of the village Dhatikidih accused him of stealing a two-wheeler, forced him to chant 'Jai Shree Ram ' and 'Jai Hanuman' and beat him badly. Later, he was rescued by police and taken to the hospital. He was arrested by police and produced in the court on the charges of theft. On June 22, his condition worsened and he was admitted to the district hospital, where he died. Six persons have been arrested in connection with this case. An SIT (Special Investigation Team ) has also been formed to look into this case. Supreme Court has made SIT mandatory for every mob lynching case.
Several cases of mob lynching have taken place in past few years out of which 12 cases of such mob lynching have taken place in the state of Jharkhand in last 4 years, including ten Muslims and two schedule tribes. Cases of mob lynching are rising in the name of protecting the cow and the self-claimed "cow protectors" unleashed violence in several parts of the country. These type of mob lynchings can lead to communal polarisation which further can become the base of riots in society.
Senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad took on BJP over its "New India" claim. He said, "please return us our old India. Never heard of a "New America", "New China" or "New Britain". There can be a modern India, but no New India. Please give us back the Old India. There was no violence, no lynching. Give us that India where all religions are equal."
On Sunday, India has rejected a US state department's annual report on religious freedom that raised questions about the government's inability to curb violent attacks on the country's minority Muslims . "Mob attacks by violent extremist Hindu groups against minority communities, especially Muslims, continued throughout the year amid rumours that victims had traded or killed cows for beef," the report said. It also noted reports by non-governmental organisations that the government sometimes failed to act on mob attacks on religious minorities, marginalised communities, and critics of the government.

SRINAGAR, June 28 -- A militant was found dead and another wounded following a suspected clash between two militant groups in Anantnag district on Wednesday, the Jammu and Kashmir Police said. The slain militant was identified as Adil Dass, who had quit the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) to join a so-called Islamic State (IS) inspired group operating in Kashmir. SRINAGAR: A militant was found dead and another wounded following a suspected clash between two militant groups in Anantnag district on Wednesday, the Jammu and Kashmir police said.
The slain militant was identified as Adil Dass, who had quit the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) to join a so-called Islamic State (IS) inspired group operating in Kashmir. Arif Hussain Bhat, the wounded militant, is a suspected member of the home-grown Hizbul Mujahideen (HM).
"It seems [there was] a group clash between HM and ISJK [Islamic State Jammu and Kashmir]," said deputy police inspector general Atul Kumar Goel.
He said a team of security forces found Bhat wounded in an orchard in Anantnag's Bijbehara and arrested him.
Goel added both were found with bullet injuries. He said the reasons for the clash were unclear. "We are investigating," he said. Goel added Bhat is undergoing treatment at a local hospital.
To be sure, rival militant groups have clashed in Kashmir in the past as well. In the 1990s, home-grown militant groups HM and Jammu and KashmirLiberation Front (JKLF) clashed frequently because of their ideological differences.
Groups owing allegiance with global terror groups like al Qaeda and IS that have emerged in Kashmir over the last few years have been critical of Pakistan.
Three suspected ISJK militants were killed in Kashmir in May and June.
Security agencies have maintained that the group has no direct connection with the IS, which overran swathes of Iraq and Syria in 2014.
Both Iraq and Syria have since declared victories over the terror group that used its bases in the two countries to carry out attacks across the world.

Srinagar, June 28 -- Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday called for tightening the noose around terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir, urging security forces to show zero tolerance towards terrorist activities and take strict action against terror funding in the state.
On the second day of his twoday visit to the state, Shah also met the widow and two children of a police officer killed in a militant attack in south Kashmir's Anantnag on June 12, at their Belgarden home. During the interaction, which lasted about half an hour, the Union minister offered the widow of the officer a government job.
Shah talked tough on terror during a security review meeting with top officials from the Centre and the state, including Governor Satya Pal Malik. He met many political and non-political delegations, including one comprising 30 sarpanches, but did not meet leaders of any mainstream party such as the National Conference, Peoples Democratic Party or the Congress, officials said.
Briefing the media, state chief secretary BVR Subrahmanyam quoted Shah as saying, "There should be zero tolerance towards terrorism and terrorists. There should be continued strict action against terror funding. The rule of law should be enforced."
Shah praised the efforts of the J&K police in countering terrorism and militancy, and said the state government should commemorate the martyrdom of its policemen in their hometowns and villages in an appropriate manner each year.
"Prominent public places should also be named after martyred policemen," Shah was quoted as saying in the meeting.
In line with what he said, Shah visited the family of slain Anantnag station house officer Arshad Khan amid tight security.
Khan was injured in a militant attack on KP Road in Anantnag on June 12, having reached the spot shortly after Central Reserve Police Force personnel were targeted and a firefight was underway. While five jawans died in the attack, Khan was airlifted to AIIMS in New Delhi and succumbed to injuries four days later.
Soon after meeting Khan's family, Shah tweeted: "Visited the home of inspector Arshad Khan, SHO Anantnag in Srinagar, who was martyred in a terror attack & offered my condolences to the bereaved family. His sacrifice for the security of our nation has saved many lives. Entire nation is proud of Arshad Khan's valour & courage."
He also interacted with a delegation of sarpanches at the Sheri-Kashmir International Conference Centre.
After the meeting, Altaf Thakur, sarpanch of Dadsara Tral, said, "Yes, we met him and demanded a separate election commission for panchayats polls in J&K and holding elections for block and district development boards, among other things. He was very receptive and asked us to work for the people, especially in rural areas."
Although he did not meet leaders of mainstream parties, he had an extended meeting with the state Bharatiya Janata Party leadership and members of the tribal association.
Former chief minister Omar Abdullah and National Conference leader tweeted: "After the two day visit of the Union Home Minister to J&K, I hope there is a better understanding of the ground realities of the situation and the need to change the approach to the state."

Srinagar, June 27 -- Reiterating Centre's "zero tolerance" towards militancy, Union Home Minister Amit Shah directed the security agencies to take strict action against militants and their financiers.
During his two-day visit, the Home Minister held number of meetings with officials to assess the security scenario in the state, review preparations for the Shri Amarnathji Yatra and provide good governance to the people in the state.
The security agencies gave a detailed briefing to the Home Minister on the overall security scenario in the state, the results achieved during the last one year and their future plans to curb militancy.
Home Minister directed the security agencies to have "zero tolerance" towards militancy and militants.
"There should be continued strict action against the militancy funding," he told the officials.
Later addressing a joint press conference, Chief Secretary B V R Subrahmanyam and Union Special Secretary Home, (Internal Security) A P Maheshwari said the Union Home Minister while appreciating the significant improvement in all the parameters relating to the security situation, directed that there should be "zero tolerance" towards militancy and militants.
"There should be continued strict action against militancy funding and the rule of law should be enforced," Subrahmanyam and Maheshwari quoted Shah having said.
Home Minister has praised the work of Jammu and Kashmir Police in "countering" militancy.
"He directed that state government should commemorate the martyrdom of its policemen in their home towns/villages in an appropriate manner. Prominent public places should also be named after slain policemen," they said.
Earlier on Thursday, Shah visited the home of slain inspector of J&K police Arshad Khan to offer condolence to the bereaved family.
Khan was killed in a fidayeen attack in Anantnag on June 12. Shah handed over a job appointment letter to his wife.
Emphasizing on strict enforcement of the SOPs, Shah asked the senior officers to personally supervise the arrangements for Yatra.
"Forces should ensure optimum use of latest technologies and the gadgets not only for the security of the Yatra but also to facilitate the movement of the devotees and the tourists," he directed.
Shah specifically drew attention of the forces towards anti-sabotage as well as anti-subversion drills and the access control procedures.
He directed the security agencies to be fully alert and take all preventive steps to ensure violence-free Amarnath Yatra.
Home Minister on the second day of his visit interacted with a representative group of Sarpanches to gain an insight into the current state of functioning of Panchayats in the state.
He also reviewed the development programmes and focused on improving the lives of the common man.
The review meeting covered a wide range of issues with a renewed focus on improving the economic condition of the people, providing them with employment and livelihood opportunities, providing them the benefit of social security schemes and raising their incomes.
He asked the state government to focus on the better and more efficient implementation of developmental schemes so that there is no corruption and the leakages are plugged.
Shah also directed that state government should ensure that old age disability and widow pensions reach all the deserving people in a timely manner.
"There should be a quick scrutiny of all the eligible people, who have been left out. It should be ensured that they are included in the scheme," Shah said.
Home Minister said that reservation benefits should reach the weaker sections of the society.
Shah noted that state government should take steps to ensure that newly created Anti-Corruption Bureau works hard to curb rampant corruption.
Home Minister asked the authorities to formulate schemes for improving the poultry, handloom and handicraft sectors in Kashmir.
Official Statement
A government spokesperson, later in the day, issued the following statement, underlining in detail the directions Home Minister issued during his two-day visit:
1. The State Government should ensure that old age, disability and widow pensions reach all those entitled to these, in a timely manner. There should be a quick scrutiny of all eligible people who are left out and ensuring that they are included. The Central Government will ensure additional funds.
2. The dairy and animal husbandry sector has great potential in this state. The State should work towards signing an MOU with Amul or Mother Dairy and create a programme for ensuring that it becomes surplus in this sector. This is a sector whose benefits would flow to even small households.
3. The Poultry sector too has great potential with the state importing large volumes of poultry products. The State should create schemes for improving the poultry sector as this sector improves the livelihoods of the poorest. The Central Government would support efforts in this direction.
4. The Handloom and Handicraft Sector is one of the brightest spots on J&K's economic landscape. The potential in this has not been fully captured. The state should take the help of the Khadi & Village Industries, MSME and Textiles departments of the Central Government to improve nearly 40 various spheres in this sector. The growth of this sector would increase employment and livelihoods of poor households.
5. The state should ensure that the newly established Panchayati Raj and Urban Local Body system takes deep roots and establishes itself as the third tier of government. There should be a drive to ensure that Panchayats and ULBs spend the funds given to them. These funds run into thousands of crores and ensuring their proper utilization would benefit the people.
6. There are many socially disadvantaged groups in the state such as Paharis, Gujars, Bakarwals and other Economically Weaker Sections. The reservation benefits extended to them should be implemented vigorously and no posts in these classes should go vacant.
7. The State Government should take steps to ensure that the newly created Anti-Corruption Bureau focuses on cases of rampant corruption by the High and Mighty.
8. Women being the key to any development process need to be at the centre of all programmes. The state should work in this direction so that women can get better employment opportunities and livelihoods.
9. Similarly, the state should prepare a programme for reaching out to the youth who are highly skilled such as MBBS, Engineers, MBAs etc. and do not have gainful employment or livelihood.
10. State Officers should be fully be sensitive towards balanced development of all the three regions, - Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh.
During the review of the preparations for the Shri Amarnathji Yatra, the Union Home Minister directed all security agencies to be fully alert and take all preventive steps to ensure violence free Yatra. He directed that:
1. There should be no laxity in the enforcement of the SOPs. Senior officers should personally supervise the arrangements at all levels.
2. Forces should ensure best possible optimum use of latest technologies and the gadgets not only for the security of the Yatra but also to facilitate the movement of the devotees and the tourists. He specifically drew attention of the Forces towards anti-sabotage as well as anti-subversion drills and the access control procedures.
Appreciating the whole-hearted cooperation of the people of the State in successful conduct of the Yatra, the Union Home Minister reassured his commitment towards best possible arrangements.
After a detailed briefing on the prevailing Security Scenario in the state, the Union Home Minister, while appreciating the significant improvement in all the parameters relating to the security situation, directed that:
1. There should be zero tolerance towards militants and militancy.
2. There should be continued strict action against terror funding.
3. The Rule of Law should be enforced.
The Union Home Minister also visited the home of the martyred Inspector of J&K Police, Late Shri Arshad Khan and consoled his bereaved family. He handed over an appointment letter to his wife for a job in the State Government.
The Union Home Minister praised the work of JK Police in countering terrorism and militancy and directed that the State Government should commemorate the martyrdom of its policemen in their hometowns/ villages in an appropriate manner each year. Prominent public places should also be named after martyred policemen.
The Union Home Minister Amit Shah further added that he would review periodically the performance of the state on multiple fronts.

Centre denies intelligence failure in Pulwama attack

Copyright 2019. HT Media Limited. All rights reserved.
New Delhi, June 27 -- The Pulwama terror attack was not a result of intelligence failure, minister of state for home affairs G Kishan Reddy told Parliament on Wednesday.
Replying to a question by Congress' Syed Nasir Hussain in Rajya Sabha, Reddy said, "All agencies are working in a coordinated manner and the intelligence inputs are shared among agencies on a real-time basis".
Over 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel lost their lives when a suicide bomber, affiliated to the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed, attacked their convoy in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama on February 14.
The Indian forces claimed they had carried out a retaliatory attack, as part of which air strikes were launched on a terrorist camp in Pakistan's Balakot on February 26.
Hussain sought to know how did the car "join the highway from a slip road which carried around 300 kg of explosives" if there was no intelligence failure.
Reddy said, "The investigation by NIA [National Investigation Agency] into the Pulwama attack so far, has resulted in identifying the conspirators, suicide attacker and the vehicle provider."
He added that a large number of terrorists have been killed in the past few years because of the government's "zero tolerance" policy towards terrorism...[ in J&K], he said.
Replying to another query, posed by BJP's Prabhat Jha, Reddy said that Indian forces have killed more than 800 terrorists since 2014. In 2014, 110 militants were killed, 108 in 2015, 150 in 2016, 213 in 2017 and 257 in 2018, Reddy said. He claimed that the Centre has formed a Joint Monitoring Committee comprising various agencies at the central level and a multi-disciplinary Terror Monitoring Group at the state level for sustained action against terror funding.

Srinagar, June 27 -- Security forces killed a militant suspected to belong to an al Qaeda affiliate in a gunfight in Pulwama district's Tral on Wednesday, the Jammu and Kashmir police said.
In a statement, the police identified the slain militant as Shabir Ahmad Malik, who was a member of the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) before joining Ansar Ghazwat ul Hind (AGH), the al Qaeda affiliate.
"Malik was part of groups responsible for planning and executing terror attacks...," the statement said without elaborating.
It added that a case had been registered against Malik for "planning and making preparations for carrying out terror attacks in Jammu".
Malik is the fifth AGH militant to have been killed since Sunday. Four AGH militants, including the group's main recruiter, Showkat Mir, were killed in a firefight with security forces at Panzar in South Kashmir's Shopian district on Sunday.
Zakir Musa, 25, who formed the AGH after quitting homegrown militant group Hizbul Mujahideen in 2017, was killed on May 23 in a gun battle with security forces.
Almost half of AGH's around a dozen militants were killed in December 2018 in Pulwama district.
The group was believed to have been almost completely wiped out after Musa's killing.

Balakot strike planner to head R&AW, kashmir expert is IB chief

Copyright 2019. HT Media Limited. All rights reserved.
New Delhi, June 27 -- Prime Minister Narendra Modi has appointed Samant Kumar Goel, who played a key role in planning the February air strikes on a terror camp in Pakistan's Balakot, as the next chief of India's external intelligence agency, the Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW), and Arvind Kumar as director of the Intelligence Bureau (IB).
Both are Indian Police Service (IPS) officers of the 1984 batch with Goel belonging to the Punjab cadre and Kumar to the Assam-Meghalaya cadre.
The two officers will take over their new posts at the end of this month, when the extended tenures of IB director Rajiv Jain and R&AW chief Anil K Dhasmana end. Jain and Dhasmana were appointed in December 2016 and were given six-month extensions as India moved into election mode ahead of the Lok Sabha polls this year.
Dhasmana's term expires on June 30 and Jain will step down a day earlier, on June 29.
By Wednesday evening, the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet, headed by the Prime Minister, also issued orders appointing the two officers to a two-year term each in their new posts.
Goel is currently special secretary and heads the operations branch at the external intelligence agency. The senior police officer was instrumental in planning the February 26 air strikes on the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terror camp in Balakot, Pakistan, in reprisal for the terrorist suicide car bombing that left 40 paramilitary troopers dead in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama 12 days earlier. Goel was also involved in planning the September 2016 surgical strikes on terror camps across the Line of Control days after terrorists killed 19 Indian soldiers in an attack on the Uri Brigade.
The two strikes have defined the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government's approach to counter terrorism emanating from the neighbouring country.
Goel handled Punjab militancy at its peak in the 1990s and is a Pakistan expert. He spent a considerable part of his career in the state,where he was posted to oversee security, intelligence and the border range. The IPS officer came to Delhi on his first assignment at R&AW in 2001.
Arvind Kumar has been closely involved in tackling Maoist extremism at the Intelligence Bureau. The special director-rank officer is also the internal intelligence agency's Kashmir expert and has been closely involved in formulating and executing the Centre's approach to terrorism in the Valley.
Kumar, who started in the IPS from Assam, moved to IB early in his career after a stint as superintendent of police of Sonitpur, one of the state's largest districts. He never went back to Assam police and continued to work at the Centre, mostly at the intelligence agency.

NEW DELHI, June 26 -- The government was non-committal in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday on its stand on Article 370 that grants a special status to Jammu and Kashmir and Article 35A granting rights to the state's permanent residents.
However on the question of controlling terrorism in the state, the minister said, "The government has adopted a policy of zero tolerance towards terrorism. Effective response is given by the security forces to counter terrorist activities in the state of Jammu and Kashmir."
In a written reply to the question on the government's viewpoint on them by Chhaya Verma, Sukhram Singh Yadav and Vishambhar Prasad Nishad, Minister of State for Home G Kishan Reddy limited his reply to state that 'Article 370 is part of the Constitution of India as temporary provisions and Article 35A is contained in the President's order in 1954 under Article 370.'
The government is shying away from the ruling BJP's declared stand in its poll manifesto titled "Sankalp Patra" that reiterates the long-standing resolve for abrogation of Article 370 and annulling of Article 35A since it is discriminatory against the non-permanent residents and as such an obstacle in the development of the state.

Another gruesome lynching

Jammu, June 26 -- Indian government's rejection of the US State Department's 2018 International Religious Freedom Report which alleged that mob attacks by violent extremist Hindu groups against minority communities, particularly Muslims, continued in India in 2018, over rumours of cow smuggling and beef consumption has come at an ironic moment when the country is faced with gruesome Jharkhand lynching and some other reports of minorities being assaulted since the BJP resumed the reins of the country for the second time. The glaring statistics of mob-lynchings in recent years is a serious indicator of the increasing grimness of the situation that the US report was talking about. On June 22, a 24 year old Muslim man succumbed to his injuries in jail after he was beaten up mercilessly for over 18 hours by vigilante groups and forced to repeatedly chant 'Jai Shri Ram' before being handed over to the police on accusations of 'theft'.
The police which happily sent the badly beaten up youth behind bars and offered just mild first-aid but registered no case against the assaulters. One arrest was made only after the death of the beaten up youth. The complicity of the state's organs and politicians in lynchings is not unique to this particular case. There is ample evidence to suggest not just police complicity in some of the cases but also the BJP leaders including ministers sharing platform with lynching accused. One minister in the BJP government even held a ceremony to honour some of the lynching accused. The US based report has now raised questions about the Indian government's inability to curb violent attacks on the country's minority Muslims and the report has been dismissed with an abject denial. The Ministry of External Affairs while rejecting the report stated that the "Indian Constitution guarantees fundamental rights to all its citizens, including its minority communities. We see no locus standi for a foreign entity to pronounce on the state of our citizens' constitutionally protected rights." The constitutional guarantees ensuring equality and fundamental rights for all citizens irrespective of their identity and community does exist but such denials do not take into account the vast gap between the statutes of the constitution and its implementation. The ground reality is inconsistent with the pluralistic and democratic values of India and its constitution. The BJP has also vehemently opposed the report, calling it 'biased and prejudiced' and claiming that PM Modi and other BJP leaders have strongly deplored violence against minorities and weaker sections of the society. This may not be entirely true as mere occasional whimpers, that came only after the government was pressurized, do not add up to strong condemnation. Directly or indirectly, the lynch mobs are known to have enjoyed some patronage at some government level in majority of these cases. It is also no secret that 58 percent of the victims of the mobs are Muslims. A sizeable percentage is also of the Dalits. The lack of seriousness of the government can also be gauged from the absence of official statistics on hate crimes in India. Whatever figures are available are through independent sources and media outlets that have attempted to track the reported cases. According to IndiaSpend, there were 117 mob lynchings between 2015 and 2018. According to another media report, 88 people were killed in these incidents. During the last five years of BJP rule, the cover of impunity provided to cow vigilantes has emboldened not just the Hindu right wing militants but also the disconnected criminalized elements who have used lynchings as an excuse to settle scores, spread panic and makes lives of any civilian vulnerable on baseless pretexts of theft, child abductions or anything else. It has also severely damaged the secular fabric of the country. In its second tenure in power, it appears that such denials and tacit patronage to lawless mobs is likely to increase. In the last one month alone, since the BJP government entered its second tenure, a slew of such incidents have been reported from various parts of the country. This is worrisome.

At the doorstep of Indian military politicization

Jammu, June 26 -- It would appear that the air chief, who is to retire this September, is auditioning for a job. While angling for a post retirement job is not unusual for those in uniform, khakis or safari suits, the air chief is likely lining up for a kick upstairs, as no less than India's first Chief of Defence Staff equivalent. This can be made out from his claim that the Pakistani air force did not cross the Line of Control (LC) at Rajauri-Naushera on 27 February, the day after India delivered its reprisal at Balakot for the Pulwama terror attack.
Media reports on his statement at a function at Gwalior air base commemorating the Kargil War's twentieth anniversary draw attention alongside to the Indian statement on Pakistani aggression and air intrusion into Indian air space that day. Explaining this away later, sources in the air force reportedly suggested that intrusion was not by Pakistani air planes but by ordnance used by the Pakistani air force in its stand-off attack on Indian military installations along the LC, which, in the event, missed their intended targets.
Perhaps the air chief - being himself a hero of the Kargil War - got carried away at his motivational talk to airmen at Gwalior air base. He was pointing out that while Indian pilots hit their target a Balakot - a controversial claim - the Pakistanis did not. For their part, the Pakistanis claim to have deliberately missed their Indian military targets, quite like the Indians - according to the Pakistani military spokesperson - missed theirs.
Only a couple of weeks back, the army let on that its two senior commanders in the sector, the army and corps commander, had escaped targeting at the tactical level headquarters that was targeted in an air raid by the Pakistanis. Media reports that the army is in the midst of shifting air defence units to the LC. For its part, the air force, staking a claim to shooting down an F-16 had provided evidence in the form of missile parts that had been recovered from the Indian side of the LC. It is apparent that till the air chief rewrote history, the version on which both sides agreed was that the Pakistanis did come across, even if they exited equally speedily chased away by intrepid airmen led by redoubtable, bewhiskered, Abhinandan Varthaman.
Admittedly, contemporary versions of events are an information war battleground and military history is collateral damage in conflict. However, for the air chief to go overboard in the manner he has must have something more to it. Of the two possible explanations above - the air chief wanting an extension and playing to the gallery at an air base - the former unfortunately may hold more water, and there lies the trouble.
Rumours are rife of an impending defence structural reform. Many commentators are making a pitch for these, arguing that the renewed mandate with an enhanced majority allows the government to do more for defence, in particular implement the reforms left over from the post Kargil era when these were first put down in the recommendations of successive review panels. The chief of defence staff equivalent appointment is a holdover from the period. The intervening governments did not have the political heft.
The current government set up a defence planning committee (DPC) under its national security adviser (NSA) early last year. It is amply clear that two of its four sub-committees, namely, on policy and strategy and plans and capability development, cannot but have a chair higher than the three chiefs. Neither can the chairman chiefs of staff rule against the other two, nor, without a conflict of interest, rule favourably on his service position sent up by him as its chief. No civilian can substitute since the defence secretary is of an inferior rank to the three chiefs. The NSA, though a man-for-all-seasons, being head of the DPC, cannot also head the two subcommittees, howsoever much he may like to play the role of the chief of defence staff. While he displaced the cabinet secretary from the strategic policy group headship, he cannot also displace a military man from heading the two sub-committees. So the government is likely to be considering elevating a military man at long last to the post of chief of defence staff equivalent.
Since the government has the option of deep selection, having set a precedent in doing so with the selection of the army chief last time, who it will appoint - if it does - is a matter of speculation. The Americans once reached down some thirty slots to elevate Colin Powell to head the joint chiefs panel there. Even so, there are two lead contenders: the air chief who hangs up his wings in September and the army chief who hangs up his boots in December.
It is no secret for readers of this publication and in this part of India, that the army chief has endeared himself to the government in his leading the army. The army chief has constantly piped up on the government's Kashmir policy. The personal interest is in his justifying to himself - as much as to others - his controversial elevation to the job based on his counter insurgency expertise, and also the government's line through its first term resulting in over 600 youth dead. The army latest play of music for the ears of its political master has been the rejection of any notion that surgical strikes were also carried out by the opposition when in government. These - to the northern army commander and its operations branch - were patented by the Modi-Doval combine. This appears to be a bit of dual positioning - the northern army commander for the army chief's baton while the army chief has the chief of defence staff chair in his sights.
The maneuverings have acquired competition. The air force has gone out of its way to bolster the ruling party head's questionable claim that some 300 terrorists perished in its aerial surgical strike. The claim turned the tables on the opposition that had till then seemingly clawed its way back based on the traditional issues as unemployment, farmers' suicides, rural distress, economic mismanagement etc. With Pulwama and its riposte at Balakot, the narrative changed.
If only the fight had stayed at the political level. Engineering a false flag operation - such as at Pulwama - cannot be put beyond the intelligence agencies. It is already clear that they were the first converts to the cultural nationalist ideology of their political minders. However, for a service to pitch-in unmindful of the traditional stipulation on being apolitical is concerning. True, the tradition has taken a beating of late. The last air chief while demitting the appointment trashed the narrative of 'strategic restraint' - the strategic doctrine of the predecessor government he had once served - in line with the then newly minted Modi government's redefining of India. Such revisionism is of a piece with the writing of a military history of South Asia's wars by a former air marshal, which at the very outset reveal cultural nationalist inspiration in his take - shared with Hindutva ideologues - that Moghuls who once ruled and lived in India were foreigners.
In the instant case, the air force - presumably miffed by the opposition's calling out the government's grandstanding - jumped into the fray. Not only did the air force serve up ammunition in support for the government's position on the curious Rafale deal, but also pushed inordinately for taking the government's word on Balakot. It lent its professionally authoritative status and credibility for political use of its political masters.
If the air chief does not have an axe to grind - and he is by all accounts an honourable man - then can it be inferred instead that the air force was put to it? This possibility is the worse one, with implications for civil-military relations in terms of politicization of the military. It bespeaks of a military brass that is politically deaf, lacking spine, ideologically persuaded or all three combined.
This is the outcome of the precedent set by this government in the army chief's appointment. The brass was served notice to speak what the government wishes to hear. This has set up the scramble. Whispers have it that a current frontrunner for next army chief has links with the new ruling party working head, dating to their juvenile friendship. The selection of a chief is a visible manifestation of potential politicization, politicization itself is what could follow: swallowing of the cultural nationalist bait by the military.
Over the coming term, the government may interpret its mandate expansively, believing that enhanced voting in its favour allows it to finally get down to the Hindutva project. This may entail constitutional changes 2022 onwards when it has control of the Rajya Sabha. If de jure changes are arrived at in a legally valid procedure - and do not fall afoul of the Supreme Court's jealous guarding of the doctrine of basic structure of the Constitution - the army has absolutely no role or say. Therefore, the government would be well-advised to sensibly keep the military at professional distance. It can do without overkill in trying - in the interim - to shape the military's political understanding in line with its thinking by an unnecessary bear-hug in its civil-military relations.

India, June 26 -- t least one militant was killed after a gunfight with security forces in Tral in south Kashmir's Pulwama district on Wednesday, ahead of Union home minister Amit Shah's two-day visit to the state.
A police official said the body of the militant was retrieved from the site of encounter. The identity and affiliation of the killed militant is being ascertained, the official said. Incriminating material, including arms and ammunition, has been recovered from the site of encounter, he added.
The operation began in the morning when the Indian Army and state police launched an operation in Branpathri forests in Tral following information about the presence of a group of militants there.

"Hiding militants opened fire at the security forces after the cordon around them was tightened. Intermittent firing exchanges are now going on between the security forces and the militants hiding in the area," police sources said, according to news agency IANS.
Shah and home secretary Rajiv Gauba will fly to Srinagar on Wednesday afternoon and return a day later. Soon after his arrival, Shah will review the security situation in Valley at a high-level meeting.
He will also chair a meeting of the Unified Command - which comprises officers of the Indian Army, Border Security Force (BSF), Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and the state police - to review steps taken for a peaceful and terror-free Amarnath Yatra and discuss ongoing and future counterterror operations.
A total of 49 paramilitary troopers, including 40 in the February 14 Pulwama attack; 13 army soldiers; seven Jammu and Kashmir police personnel; and three special police officers have lost their lives this year in terror operations, according to state police data.

All over in 90 seconds, families didn't know, say Balakot pilots

Gwalior, June 25 -- The Indian air strike on a Jaish-e-Mohammed(JeM ) terror camp in Pakistan's Balakot was "over within 90 seconds" and the mission was carried out with such secrecy that not even close family members of the assault team knew about the developments, two pilots part of the predawn operation on February 26 said on Tuesday.
Indian Air Force (IAF) fighter planes destroyed the JeM camp in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's province after entering Pakistani airspace for the first time in 48 years following a suicide bombing claimed by the terror group that killed 40 troopers of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama on February 14.
"It was over in 90 seconds; we released the weapon and we turned back," said one of the Mirage 2000 fighter pilots in the first such account of the Indian airstrike.
"No one, not even my close family knew," the IAF pilot said, asking not to be named.
"Next day, when news broke, my wife asked me whether I was part of the attack. I kept quiet and slept off," he added.
The Pulwama attack led to an escalation in tensions between India and Pakistan and pushed the two countries to the brink of war as the IAF strike was followed by an engagement by Pakistani combat jets near the Line of Control (LoC) on February 27. Pakistan later released IAF pilot Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, whose jet went down across the LoC, under global pressure, easing tensions between the two nations.

With Amarnath Yatra just days away, security forces focus on quick action, IED threat
Shaurya Karanbir Gurung

(This article was originally published by The Economic Times on 24/06/2019.) NEW DELHI: Strengthening Quick Action Teams and convoy movement to improving counter-IED measures, including training and bomb squads, and having better deployment patterns, are some of the steps being taken by the security forces in light of recent terrorist attacks and the oncoming Amarnath Yatra in Jammu and Kashmir, officials said. The issues were raised during a recent assessment on the security situation and the pilgrimage in the state. The need for improving the airborne surveillance by UAVs and helicopters and the Road Opening Party (ROP) between Ramban and Jawahar tunnel were some of the points for consideration for the Yatra and work on them is happening, officials said. One of the two routes for the pilgrimage (from July 1-August 15) passes through the tunnel.
The ROP for the Ramban-Jawahar tunnel area is being reviewed in view of the emerging threat of vehicle-borne Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). The ROP will look at blocking link roads during military convoy movement. Additional troops will also be deployed on the stretch. The move gains importance following a blast inside a private car on the Jammu-Srinagar highway, near the Jawahar tunnel, in March when a Central Reserve Police Force convoy was passing. Although the incident didn’t cause casualties, it triggered memories of the February 14 Pulwama terrorist attack when an explosives laden vehicle rammed into a CRPF bus which was part of a convoy, killing 40 soldiers. Officials said that the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for convoy movement is being revised. Work is being done on having a composition of escort vehicles for handling vehicle-borne attacks. The number of Mine Protected Vehicles and bulletproof vehicles are being increased. The bomb detection and disposal teams and the dog squads tasked with countering Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) are also being improved. More bomb-disposal squads are being trained and will soon be deployed in J&K. Soldiers deployed in the state are also being trained in counter-IED methods. Even for the Amarnath Yatra, more number of bomb and dog squads, besides anti-sabotage teams are being deployed on the yatra route as compared to last year. “There has been an increase in the security arrangements for the yatra this year,” explained an official. Surveillance and communication equipment will also be deployed for the route. More Quick Action Teams (QATs) and troops for night domination and mobile check-posts in addition to the regular deployment will take place. The QATs, which have been provided with specialised equipment, are also an important step against terrorist encounters. These teams have engaged terrorists in at least 30 encounters from January 2018 till March this year. Their equipment and strength will be further improved.Officials explained that terrorist related activities could increase with suicide attacks being a focus for terrorists. Around 115 terrorists have been killed by security forces so far this year in comparison to 257 last year. There are still close to 290 terrorists currently active in J&K. This comprises of cadres mainly from Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed and Hizbul Mujahideen. Security forces have to also deal with improvement in the arsenal of terrorists. There have been four instances of terrorists using armour piercing ammunition. Grenade throwing and use of IEDs are other main terrorist activities. There have been around seven IED blasts this year, including on an army vehicle that killed two soldiers earlier this month. Last year, there were 10 IED blasts. There have also been 38 grenade blasts this year as compared to 91 in 2018. The number of stone pelting incidents upto early June this year is 237, much less as compared to 1,226 last year and 876 in 2017. However, these activities remain a threat to the yatra, which has faced terrorist attacks in the past.

10 Local Militants Active In Kishtwar: IGP

JAMMU, June 24 -- At least 10 local militants, mostly belonging to the Hizbul Mujahideen outfit, are active in Kishtwar district, Inspector General of Police, Jammu, M K Sinha said Monday.
A total of 10 militnats -- eight belonging to the Hizbul Mujahideen (HM) and two to the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) are active in Kishtwar district, Sinha told reporters, adding all of them are local youths.
Kishtwar was declared militancy-free over a decade ago, but was rattled by the killing of State Secretary of BJP Anil Parihar and his brother Ajeet Parihar on November 1 last year, followed by assassination of senior RSS leader Chanderkant Sharma and his security guard inside a health centre on April 9.
So far, the militants behind the killings have evaded arrests even as security forces launched a massive operation to track them down and had two brief gunfights with the hiding terrorists on May 31 in Appan area of Marwah and again on June 21 in Keshwan forest.
While two special police officers were injured in Marwah encounter, a suspected militant was believed to have been injured in Keshwan, but the terrorists managed to escape from both the places.
Asked whether it was worrying for the security forces that the ultras managed to give them a slip after establishing contact with them, he said, "We have learnt our lessons and will go fully prepared next time when there is an information about their presence."
When police received information about presence of militants in Marwah, an advance party was sent for recce of the area "but unfortunately it came under fire and the ultras fled. Same was the case in Keshwan," he said.

'Will push to resolve Kashmir problem': Hasnain Masoodi
Harinder Baweja

India, June 24 -- Anantnag, a one-hour drive from Srinagar, lies in the heart of south Kashmir, one of the most troubled zones in the strife-torn Valley. Already, in the few weeks since the general election results were announced on May 23, Anantnag has made headlines for a terror attack that killed a policeman and five Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel as well as for an encounter between militants and security forces that claimed the life of an army officer. Pulwama, where 40 CRPF?troopers were killed in a suicide car bombing on February 14, is part of the constituency.
Anantnag is also the place that bred the young Burhan Wani, who disappeared into the mountains of Tral only to emerge on social media, AK-47 in hand, as the head of militant group Hizbul Mujahideen. When Wani was killed by security forces in July 2016, Kashmir erupted in massive civilian unrest - over 100 died and several thousand were injured in protests.
It is in Anantnag that Hasnain Masoodi, 65, a former judge of the Jammu and Kashmir high court -he retired in 2016 - entered the electoral fray as a National Conference candidate and won.

Masoodi had never dabbled in electoral politics and was surprised when NC president Farooq Abdullah called on him one afternoon in April for a cup of tea, and asked him to join the party. The two had earlier worked together to devise a strategy around the legal battle on Article 35A of the Indian Constitution that allows the state's legislature to define who is a "permanent resident," eligible for special privileges such as government employment and acquisition of property, among other things.
Since 2014, Article 35A has been challenged in the Supreme Court. Both the NC and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) have filed interventions seeking to question the legal challenge. Separately, last year, Article 370, which grants special status to J&K, was also challenged in the Supreme Court.
Significantly, in 2015, in another case, a division bench of the J&K high court comprising Masoodi and justice Janak Raj Kotwal ruled that Article 370 was "beyond amendment, repeal or abrogation". It also held that Article 35A gave "protection" to existing laws in force in the state and to any law enacted after 1954 by the state legislature.
"We were looking for somebody who has the gravitas to take a strong message to the area, particularly on issues like 35A and Article 370," said former chief minister and the NC president's son, Omar Abdullah.
"He is a man who knows the law and can talk about issues that are vital to Kashmir," Farooq Abdullah said.
What do you prefer, HT asked Masoodi - a court of law or the people's court? "As a judge, I would hear and adjudicate on cases that were brought to my court. I couldn't go to somebody's place or choose issues. Now, hundreds of people come without a formal application. The canvas is much wider," he replied.
A postgraduate in law from Harvard University, an Ivy League college in the United States, Masoodi is hardly in a position to choose - Anantnag does that for him, and most of the options are bleak. The data from police records that he used in his election speeches offers a glimpse of his priorities: in five years, 91,000 houses searched in nocturnal cordon-and-search operations, 450 deaths and 32,000 arrests. The statistics he cites feed the anger and alienation experienced by his constituents.
Also read: The worrying rise of local militancy
Anantnag constituency comprises 16 assembly segments, each as volatile as the next. Masoodi would know. He escaped a grenade attack at an NC election meeting at party leader Muhammad Ashraf Bhat's home in Tral in April. Masoodi's home in Khrew (a part of Anantnag) was attacked in 2014, when his son, Yawar, a practising lawyer, was NC's candidate for the 2014 assembly elections and two security guards were killed. Despite the risks, winning Anantnag seemed easier than what lies ahead.
Masoodi defeated Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chief Mehbooba Mufti by close to 10,000 votes and the Congress' Ghulam Ahmad Mir by over 7,000 votes, but his victory came out of one of the lowest voter turnouts. Unlike in 2014, when the voter turnout was 28.84%, this year only 8.31%of 1.3 million registered electors cast their vote in an election that was spread over three phases.
This was, in large part, due to Mufti's alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), even though in her 2014 general election campaign, Mufti, who had won from Anantnag, had asked the electorate to vote in large numbers, to prevent the BJP from opening its account in the state. "They will abrogate Article 370 and are a threat to our identity," she had said.
The BJP's election manifesto this year stated that it would do away with articles 370 and 35A - an issue that state leaders from both the PDP and the NC have reacted against.
"We don't have an elected government in Jammu and Kashmir, so there is a lot of pressure on me," Masoodi said.
"Jammu and Kashmir is not like any other state. With the new dispensation at the Centre, issues regarding our identity and autonomy have taken centre stage. We have a right to our identity and I am glad that I have got a chance to voice this in Parliament,'' said the new MP, who feels politics is the best medium to serve the people.
He hopes his legal prowess will stand him in good stead. "Mehbooba Mufti painted our youth as terrorists. Justice has been made unavailable to thousands of people. The state arrests our boys and keeps them in lock-up without FIRs [first information reports]," he said.
Masoodi's ties to Khrew run deep. His mother, Zainab, was the first woman to set up a school in Khrew. She was appointed to do so by Maharaja Hari Singh in 1938. As a judge, he is also known for a verdict which stated that Muslim men's power to divorce their wives was not unrestricted, but needed proof of attempts to settle disputes. Now, as an MP, a large part of his day is spent meeting parents of young Kashmiris who are in detention.
Also read: JeM militant killed in encounter near Line of Control
Among those who now flock to him are people who did not vote. "I did not vote. There was widespread fear in Pulwama," said Bashir Ahmad, a government employee.
He, however, sought Masoodi out to help him secure the release of his son, Raees-ul-Islam, currently in jail in Jammu's Kot Balwal. Masoodi's phone rings incessantly and he excuses himself to answer it. "I can't afford to not answer the phone." Another father has called for help.
With the BJP winning 303 seats for a clear majority in Parliament, Masoodi said Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been gifted with a unique opportunity to create history. "He can be known as someone who worked for peace in South Asia if he pays heed to our aspirations," Masoodi said.
"I will push very hard for a resolution of the Kashmir problem. We need an 'Operation All Out' to address the alienation. For how long will we keep carrying bodies?" he asked.
Successive chief ministers, including from the NC, have often been ignored by Delhi when they've called for a dialogue. "I don't know about success, but I will definitely make a noise. We deserve to be heard," he said.

Srinagar, June 24 -- Four militants allegedly belonging to the Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind group were on Sunday killed in Panzar in south Kashmir's Shopian district in a joint operation by the Jammu and Kashmir Police and the Indian Army.
Police identified the militants as Showkat Ahmad Mir alias Arshid from Chandpora Rajpora, Azad Ahmad Khanday alias Molvi from Bamnoo Pulwama, Suhail Ahmad Bhat from Berthipora, and Rafi Hassan Mir from Kralchack Shopian. Two of the four militants had joined militant ranks only a week ago.
Showkat Mir, who was earlier affiliated to the Hizbul Mujahideen, was a recruiter for militant group Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind and was active since 2015, inspector general of police, Kashmir, Swam Prakash Pani, said. He termed the operation as being without collateral damage.p4

‘Offer’ of talks comes amid bloodshed in Valley

SRINAGAR/NEW DELHI,NATIONAL A record number of 88 locals were killed this year, and highly trained militants are being pushed into the Valley The reported offer of talks by the Hurriyat leadership comes smack in the middle of operations against terrorists in Kashmir, in which a record number of 88 locals had been killed this year. The Jammu & Kashmir administration has said that recruitment to militant ranks is at its lowest now.
But since June 12 alone, 10 security personnel, five of them CRPF men, lost their lives, and 10 others were injured in various attacks, including the fidayeen strike in Anantnag on June 12 and a blast using an improvised explosive device (IED) in Pulwama on June 17. These took the death toll of security personnel to 73, the highest since the corresponding period of 2005, when over 100 were killed.
A quiet trip
As the battle against militancy continued, the Centre’s Special Representative for Jammu and Kashmir, Dineshwar Sharma, quietly visited Srinagar — his first trip after the Lok Sabha election results were announced on May 23.
The visit followed J&K Governor Satya Pal Malik’s statement on Saturday that the Hurriyat leaders were ready for talks and a change of guard in the Home Ministry, where BJP president Amit Shah has assumed office as Home Minister.
Mr. Sharma was appointed in 2017 to carry forward the dialogue with all stakeholders, but his role had been undermined in the past by parallel action initiated by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and the Enforcement Directorate. Several separatists, including Syed Ali Shah Geelani and Mirwaiz Umer Farooq, are being investigated by the agency for funding terror groups.
“Yes, this was the first time after the general elections that I went to Srinagar. I would not like to disclose anything about the meetings,” Mr. Sharma told The Hindu.
Of late, terrorists in Kashmir have resorted to new tactics. Buoyed by back-to-back successful operations against local militants in the past six weeks without any major casualty, Major Ketan Sharma, 32, was confident of wrapping up within hours a pre-dawn operation started around 4 a.m. against a hiding militant at Badoora village in Anantnag on June 17.
Surprise element
The Army, however, was taken by surprise by the level of training of the “non-local” militant of the Jaish-e-Muhammad (JeM). Major Sharma took bullets inches below the bulletproof headgear on the face, as he volunteered to neutralise the hiding militant with grenades while changing position in an uneven courtyard.
“As soldiers raised their heads to fire at his position, the militant would fire back with precision. He succeeded in hitting four jawans. The fact he hit the Major in the face shows his level of training. He was a freshly infiltrated militant [from Pakistan]. There is a bid to push highly trained militants from across from the border,” a senior police officer told The Hindu.
As the operation drew to a close at Achabal, three soldiers suffered injuries, while Major Sharma lost his life.
Changing tack
Top police officers of the counter-insurgency cell and the special operations group (SOG) said the surprise element thrown up by the militants by changing tack and technology resulted in higher casualties this year.
“First, the suicide car blast on a CRPF convoy on February 14 inflicted the highest casualties, when 40 jawans died. In June, we saw a fidayeen militant coming close to a stationed CRPF mobile bunker at Anantnag’s busy market, killing five jawans and a police officer. In both these incidents, there was a surprise element,” a south Kashmir-based police officer said.
The change in tack and technology by terrorists was because the surprise, short pre-dawn operations employed by the security forces were yielding results, with 113 militants killed this year, the police officer said.
Of the 113, 25 were foreigners. “Around 45% of them belonged to the Jaish-e-Muhammad. We stepped up operations against the group and its leadership after the February 14 attack and killed over 40 of them in south Kashmir,” another counter-insurgency cell officer said.
Another new tactic employed by the militants is to make IEDs locally and stage attacks away from the now-secured Srinagar-Jammu highway, which was, previously, the main focus of the militants.
“The June 17 IED attack, where it was fitted to a Maruti car, took place on an interior road near Aarihal in Pulwama. Over 10 jawans were injured and two were left dead,” the police officer said.
As the security forces take on the terrorists, it remains to be seen what happens with the reported offer of talks and the follow-up on Mr. Sharma’s visit.

The worrying rise of local militancy
Mir Ehsan

Srinagar, June 24 -- Mohammad Salman Khan and Shabir Ahmad Dar deserted the Jammu and Kashmir police's counter-insurgency wing to cross over to the other side on June 5. The special police officers (SPOs) left Pulwama's district police lines with their automatic weapons and joined Pakistan-based terror group Jaish-e-Mohammad four months after it carried out one of the deadliest attacks in Kashmir on February 14 that left 40 paramilitary troopers dead.
Within hours of their desertion, security forces raided a house after being tipped off about the duo's presence at Panjran Lassipora, around 12 kilometres from the police lines. In a night-long exchange of fire, the SPOs were killed along with two other militants holed up in the house.
Khan and Dar represent a continuing trend of Kashmiri youths joining the militant ranks. The recruits have come from various professional and economic backgrounds. The two belonged to Pulwama, which has emerged over the last three years as a militant hotbed. They had joined the Jammu and Kashmirpolice in 2016. Khan, a graduate, came from a modest background. His father is a farmer. Dar came from a well-to-do family. "Dar's father is an officer in J&K's industries department and owns apple and almond orchards. When he joined the police for a meagre salary, everyone was surprised, even his parents. A day before joining militancy, he [Dar] came home for Eid and had lunch with the family. Nobody knows why he joined and then left the police to join militants,'' said a relative.
The trend started in 2010 when 15-year-old Burhan Wani dropped out of Class X and joined the home-grown militant group, Hizbul Mujahideen. He posted his pictures on social media that showed him carrying an AK-47. Many Kashmiri youths have since followed in Wani's footsteps; so much so that local militants have started outnumbering foreign terrorists for the first time since 1989 when the insurgency in Kashmir began.
According to police records, 66 of them joined the militant ranks in 2015. The number went up to 88 in 2016, 126 in 2017 and 196 in 2018.
At least 45 youths have joined militant organisations in the first five months of this year, the records read. At least seven of them were pursuing bachelor's degrees and one a master's in technology. At least 61 youths had joined militancy in April and May last year alone. Six youths have joined militant ranks this month in Pulwama, Baramulla and Kupwara even as the police have claimed to have convinced two of them to quit militancy.
According to a police statement on Tuesday, two youths from Pulwama have returned to the mainstream with the help of their families and community leaders. Officials said that this year more than 10 youths have left the militant ranks.
Militants have also begun to find recruits in north Kashmir, where Junaid Farooq, who is from Baramulla, is the latest to join their ranks in June. A post-graduation student, Farooq joined the Hizbul Mujahideen five months after the district was declared free of local militants.
On June 18, 19-year-old Adnan Ahmad Channa's picture showing him carrying a gun went viral days after he disappeared from Baramulla's Arampora area.
In March, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) leader Zaffar Manhas's nephew, Kamran, 20, who was pursuing a B Tech, joined the militant ranks. "My nephew had studied at Sainik School, Manasbal, till Class X. I am surprised by his decision," said Manhas.
A Kashmir university assistant professor, Mohammad Rafi Bhat, was killed in Shopian a day after he joined militancy in May last year. A police officer said eight people from his force, too, have joined militancy over the last five years and insisted it was not a "big development".
Political analyst Gowhar Geelani blamed the absence of any dialogue for the trend. "All communication channels are closed and both... [separatists] and ...Unionist forces have failed to strike a chord with the youths." He said New Delhi has continued with its "we-will-not-bend and its militaristic and muscular Kashmir policy".
Muneer Ahmad Khan, an additional director general of police, blamed social media for the trend, mostly in South Kashmir.

Search ops on in Kishtwar to neutralise suspected terrorists

Jammu, June 23 -- A massive search operation continued for the second consecutive day on Saturday to track down suspected terrorists in a forest area of Jammu and Kashmir's Kishtwar district, around 235 kms from here.
The special operations group (SOG) of Jammu and Kashmir Police had launched a search operation in the forest area near Keshwan village early on Friday following information about the movement of suspected militants.
A brief gunfight took place between the terrorists and the search parties on Friday and it is believed that one of them got injured, but managed to flee along with his accomplices inside the dense forest, officials, Defence spokesman Lt Col Devender Anand said. Blood stains were spotted near the scene of the gunfight. He informed that the army had joined the operation at a later stage during the day.
The search operation is on and sniffer dogs were pressed into service to track down the militants.
On May 31, two special police officers were injured in an encounter with terrorists in Appan area of Marwah belt in the same district. The ultras had managed to escape after the encounter. Kishtwar, which was declared terrorism-free over a decade ago, was rattled by the killing of BJP leader Anil Parihar and his brother Ajeet Parihar on November 1, followed by the killing of RSS leader Chandrakant Sharma and his security guard Rajinder Kumar inside the district hospital on April 9.
A top district official confided to HT that dense forests, snow and caves make upper reaches of Marwah are a safe haven for terrorists.
"Terrorists move in the upper reaches and once they are in a natural cave, it becomes very difficult to trace them," he said. It may be stated here that Sinthan Pass in Kishtwar district connects militancy-infested south Kashmir's Anantnag district.
On May 20, Northern Army commander Lt Gen Ranbir Singh had said there were no confirmed reports of terrorists south of Pir Panjal.
In last fortnight, around three militants hideouts with arms and ammunition have been busted by the security forces in Kishtwar and adjoining area.

Srinagar, June 23 -- A Jaish-e-Mohammed militant was killed in an encounter with security forces in north Kashmir's Baramulla district on Saturday.
A cordon and search operation was launched by security forces in Boniyar area in the early hours after movement of militants was detected in the area which is close to the Line of Control.
During the search operation, the militants opened fire towards security forces who retaliated, army spokesperson said.
"In the exchange of fire, one unidentified ultra was killed at Bujthala in Boniyar Uri," he said, adding the identity and group affiliation of the slain militant was being ascertained.
Weapons and warlike stores were seized from the site of encounter.
"Searches are still going on in the area although firing exchanges have stopped now," police sources said.
Sources, however, said the militant killed in the operation was a foreigner and it remains unclear as to what he was doing in that area.
In the past, the area, which is close to the Line of Control, has been used by militants for infiltration and exfiltration. In the first five months, army and police claimed to have killed more than 100 militants in different parts of Kashmir.
In the second week of June, four youths were arrested by army in the Uri sector while they were trying to cross the Line of Control.
They were handed over to police after counselling.
The youths said they were trying to reach Pakistan Occupied Kashmir for arms training, however, were arrested midway near Boniyar.

Commanders whose bases attacked may have to leave
Sudhi Ranjan Sen

New Delhi, June 22 -- Commanders who were in charge of the Uri brigade, the Sunjuwan military camp and the Nagrota army base in Jammu and Kashmirwhen their establishments were stormed by terrorists in past years may have "to go home", the government has decided, seeking to take action against the senior leadership for security lapses that may have aided the attacks.
The government has communicated its recommendation to the Indian Army, a senior official in the security establishment said, requesting anonymity because he is not authorised to speak to the media.
Essentially, the government wants these officers to put in their papers and retire. The officers will still be eligible to receive all the benefits that are due to them, he added.
"The army was communicated that commanders should put in their papers days after the new government was sworn in," said a second official in the security establishment, who also did not want to be named.
The decision comes less than a month after the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) was sworn in for a second successive term in office after winning a commanding majority in the April-May general elections.
A total of 36 army personnel died in the three attacks, two of which - on the Uri brigade and the Nagrota base - took place in 2016, and the third - on the Sunjuwan camp - last year.
An Indian Army spokesperson did not comment on the government's decision. "I have no information," the spokesperson said in reply to a query by HT.
A group of terrorists sneaked into the Brigade Headquarters in Uri, killing 19 soldiers, on September 18, 2016. Seven soldiers, including an officer, died when terrorist stormed the 14 Corps Artillery Brigade located in Nagrota on November 29, 2016. Eleven soldiers were killed when terrorists attacked the Sunjuwan camp on February 10, 2018.
The Uri attack prompted the Indian Army to carry out crossborder "surgical strikes" on terrorist camps on 28 September, 2016, an action that sparked fears of war between India and Pakistan
Inquires by the Indian Army into the Uri attack revealed lapses, according to the first official.
For instance, troops were housed in tents although safer shelters were available. Importantly, there had been prior information about a possible attack.
Similarly, inquiries into the attacks in Nagrota and Sunjuwan also revealed command and control lapses, the official said. For instance, a terrorist breached the security cordon in Nagrota and entered the camp but was not detected by multiple layers of security.
A machine-gun mounted security post that came in the way of the terrorist allegedly offered no resistance.
Action against commanders is not a completely new proposal. During the NDA's previous regime, then defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman had pushed for strong action in such cases. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had expressed his extreme displeasure over the attacks in conversations with the army and air force chiefs, a third government official said on condition of anonymity. The military, however, resisted, he added.
On its part, the government wants to hold senior leadership responsible for lapses that may have aided the terror attacks. After the Modi government came back to power last month, it revived the move for action against commanders under whose watch their establishments were attacked by terrorists, a fourth senior official who did not want to be named said.
The Indian Army is not keen to retire the commanders because of operational issues. "The attacks have been probed. Necessary steps have been initiated already, can action be initiated again?" a senior Indian Army officer, who did not want to be named, asked.
Interestingly, one of the base commanders had just assumed charge two days before the attack.
The military had resisted previous attempts by the government to initiate exemplary action against officers on grounds that any action, other than removal from command, against them could set a bad precedent and make future commanders engaged in counter-insurgency and counterterror (CICT) operations apprehensive.
"Being removed from command is disgraceful," General Bipin Rawat, the army chief, had earlier said when asked whether the army was considering stricter action.
The army had also argued that punishing officers for terror attacks would lead to a "fortress mindset" at a time when militaries spend more energy protecting bases and minimising casualties rather than pursuing terrorists.
"If officers are punished for terrorists managing to carry out an attack, casualties of soldiers, the focus and tempo of counterterror operations in Jammu and Kashmir and the north-eastern states will have to change," another senior army officer, who has served many years in Jammu and Kashmir, said.

BJD under fire over party flag on coffin of Odisha jawan killed in Pulwama

Bhubaneswar, June 22 -- The ruling Biju Janata Dal (BJD) has come under fire after some of its workers allegedly put the party flag on the coffin of the Indian Army soldier, who was killed in an IED attack in south Kashmir's Pulwama.
Ajit Sahoo of 44 Rashtriya Rifles was killed when militants attacked the bullet and mine-proof patrol vehicle with an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) in Arihal village of Pulwama district. Six soldiers, including Sahoo, and two civilians were injured in the attack. Sahoo and one other soldier later succumbed to their injuries.
Sahoo's older brother Parameswar said at Khuntuni some BJD workers put up the green party flag with the image of a conch on top of the tricolour-draped coffin while offering flowers. He was accompanying his brother's coffin to their native village of Badasunalo. "I immediately removed it as I felt it was wrong. My brother was martyred for the country and not any party," he said.
The incident triggered outrage after a few photos of the BJD flag on the jawan's coffin went viral on social media on Thursday night. Condemning the incident, the BJD said the party has enormous respect towards martyrs. "The matter that has come to our notice is extremely unfortunate and we strongly condemn it. The party will find out who is responsible for this and take the stringent action against them," BJD spokesperson Sasmit Patra said.
The opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) held a press conference and called it a national disgrace. "It was a dishonour to the jawan. BJD workers should never have done it. The party should apologise and action should be taken against the culprits," the BJP's ex-serviceman cell chief Col (retd) BK Bastia said.
The BJP's national vice-president Baijayant Panda tweeted: "Very unfortunate politicising death of an Indian soldier by the ruling party in Odisha draping his coffin with their party flag instead of tricolour".
Sahoo's brother said the issue shouldn't be politicised.

Ex-JeM trainer behind use of IEDs in vehicles in Kashmir, say officials
Shishir Gupta
691 words
22 June 2019
Hindustan Times

Copyright 2019. HT Media Limited. All rights reserved.
New Delhi, June 22 -- Indian intelligence officers and counterterrorism experts in Jammu and Kashmir police suspect that Abdul Rasheed Ghazi, an improvised explosive devices (IEDs) expert and former trainer at the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terrorist camp in Pakistan's Balakot, is behind the use of vehicle-borne IEDs in the Valley.
Terrorists used an IED to target an army patrol in Arihal, in Pulwama district, on Monday, injuring a dozen soldiers, two of whom died the following day. The army called the attack "a failed" one and said the IED was "vehicle-based". On Wednesday, another IED was defused by security forces in Shopian district of south Kashmir.
Pulwama in south Kashmir is the site of the February 14 suicide car bombing that killed 40 troopers of the Central Reserve Police Force. In retaliation for the attack, for which JeM claimed responsibility, the Indian Air Force bombed the Balakot terror camp on February 26, heightening tensions with Pakistan and sparking fears of a war between the nuclear-armed neighbours.
According to counterterrorism experts, Ghazi, an Afghan war veteran who belongs to Mansehra in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where Balakot is also located, is currently in the Kashmir Valley training local JeM cadre in handling explosive devices. The motivation is said to be revenge for the elimination of two relatives of JeM chief Masood Azhar -- Usman Haider and Talha Rasheed -- by Indian security forces in 2017 and 2018, respectively.
Ghazi had personally launched Usman Haider alias Huzaifa, a nephew of Azhar's, and other operatives from the Shakargarh sector in October 2018. Hyder was gunned down by security forces in Tral, Pulwama, on October 30.
Ghazi infiltrated into J&K on December 9 along with three other terrorists and set up an operational base in Pulwama, the people cited in the first instance said. Ghazi is currently hiding in the Valley and is imparting training to local Kashmiris in IED fabrication using locally available explosive material including ammonium nitrate, counterterrorism experts said on condition of anonymity .
According to Kashmir police experts, terrorists are increasingly using vehicle-borne IEDs, or VIEDs, given the fact that the hardcore cadre strength of JeM has been culled to a mere 50-odd while the cadre strength of the Lashkar-e-Taiba, another Pakistan-based terrorist group, in Kashmir is around 30-40.
" The VIED gives total deniability to both Pakistan-based groups though in these cases the group behind the attacks is Jaish. Rather than lose trained terrorists to Indian security forces, the best option is to pack explosive into a stationary car and leave it on rural roads with timed explosion. It is an act of desperation to survive and continue jihad against India," said a senior J& K police officer.
Senior J&K Police officers say that the use of VIEDs is reminiscent of the 2004-2005 period when the terrorist cadre strength of the Hizbul Mujahideen and Pakistan-based terror groups declined. The result was recourse to using vehicle-mounted IEDs like in Arihal on Monday.
Pakistan watchers in South Block believe that the Rawalpindi general headquarters is running with the hares and hunting with the hounds following the Balakot strike by the Indian Air Force.
According to them, a classic example of skulduggery on the part of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) was evident in an anonymous caller tipping off the Indian high commission in Islamabad about an impending VIED blast before the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Bhishek, Kyrgyzstan, this month and the triggering of such a device in Arihal after the completion of the summit.
"The whole idea is to get total deniability of Pak-based groups and ISI in terror attacks in the state. The so-called tip-off is to remove Islamabad from the list of suspects," said a South Block official on condition of anonymity.

FATF warns Pak., but keeps it off the blacklist
Sriram Lakshman,

Washington,INTERNATIONAL Watchdog urges the country, which is still on the greylist, to finish the stipulated action plan by Oct. Pakistan has avoided being placed on the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) blacklist during the multilateral financial watchdog’s plenary meetings in Orlando, Florida held from June 16 to 21.
However, the country, which continued to remain on a greylist, was given a warning at the end of the plenary session and told that it lacked a proper understanding of transnational terrorist financing.
Indian efforts
The mention of transnational terrorist financing is significant in light of India’s efforts to isolate Pakistan on the international stage in the context of its support for terror in Kashmir. “The FATF expresses concern that not only did Pakistan fail to complete its action plan items with January deadlines, it also failed to complete its action plan items due May 2019. The FATF strongly urges Pakistan to swiftly complete its action plan by October 2019 when the last set of action plans are set to expire. Otherwise, the FATF will decide the next step at that time for insufficient progress,” a FATF statement released on Friday read.
In June 2018, Pakistan was placed on a FATF greylist of countries whose laws do not adequately deal with money laundering and terrorist financing and agreed to a 10-point action plan to strengthen its anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism and proliferation regime.
On Friday however, the FATF said in a statement that while Pakistan had taken steps to improve its AML/CFT regime, “it does not demonstrate a proper understanding of Pakistan’s transnational TF [terrorist financing] risk.”
When the last FATF plenary session concluded in February, days after a terrorist attack killed over forty Indian security personnel in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan had avoided being blacklisted despite pressure from India. Pakistan-based terror outfit, Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) claimed responsibility for the attack. However it also did not take Pakistan off of the greylist as the country had wanted.
In April this year Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi had said that being greylisted could cost Pakistan $10 billion a year.
Blacklist, greylist criteria
To stay off of the FATF blacklist, the support of at least three of a total of 36 (excluding two regional organisations) FATF members is required. Fifteen members need to support a country’s move off of the greylist, as per the FATF charter.
FATF continued to call for countermeasures against Iran and North Korea.
The FATF noted that Iran had not completed its action plan which expired in January 2018 and listed seven points for Iran to complete, noting however that Iran had made progress, including by passing the Anti-Money Laundering Act.
Countermeasures against Iran would continue to be suspended, a statement released on Friday said, with “the exception of FATF calling upon members and urging all jurisdictions to require increased supervisory examination for branches and subsidiaries of financial institutions based in Iran, in line with the February 2019 Public Statement.”

Worrying trend in Valley as more locals join militancy

India, June 21 -- Mohammad Salman Khan and Shabir Ahmad Dar deserted the Jammu and Kashmir police's counter-insurgency wing to cross over to the other side on June 5. The special police officers (SPOs) left Pulwama's district police lines with their automatic weapons and joined Pakistan-based terror group Jaish-e-Mohammad four months after it carried out one of the deadliest attacks in Kashmir on February 14 that left 40 paramilitary troopers dead.
Within hours of their desertion, security forces raided a house where security forces were tipped off about the duo's presence at Panjran Lassipora, around 12 km from the police lines. In a night-long exchange of fire that followed, the SPOs were killed along with two other militants holed up in the house.
Khan and Dar represent a continuing trend of Kashmiri youths joining the militant ranks. The recruits have come from different professional backgrounds.
The two belonged to Pulwama, which has emerged over the last three years as a militant hotbed. They had joined the Jammu and Kashmir police in 2016. Khan, a college graduate, came from a modest background. Dar came from a well-to-do family.
"Dar's father is an officer in Jammu and Kashmir's industries department and owns apple and almond orchards. When he joined the police for a meagre salary, everyone was surprised; even his parents. A day before joining militancy, he [Dar] came home for Eid and had lunch with the family. Nobody knows why he joined and then left the police to join the militants,'' said one of Dar's relatives.
The trend first started in 2015 when a 15-year-old Burhan Wani dropped out of Class X and joined the homegrown militant group, Hizbul Mujahideen. He posted his unmasked pictures on social media that showed him carrying an AK-47. Many Kashmiri youths have since followed in Wani's footsteps so much so that local militants have started outnumbering foreign terrorists for the first time since 1989 when the insurgency in Kashmir began.
According to police records, 66 of them joined militant ranks in 2015. The number went up to 88 in 2016, 126 in 2017 and 196 in 2018. At least 45 youths have joined militant organisations in the first five months of this year. At least seven of them were pursuing bachelor's degrees while one his master's in technology. As many as 61 youths had joined militancy in April and May last year alone.
Six youths have joined militant ranks this month in Pulwama, Baramulla and Kupwara even as the police have claimed to have convinced two of them to quit militancy. A police statement on Tuesday said two youths from Pulwama have returned to the mainstream. Officials said this year more than 10 youths have left the militant ranks.
"All communication channels are closed," said political analyst Gowhar Geelani, adding, New Delhi has continued with its "we-will-not-bend and its militaristic and muscular Kashmir policy".

Today's Paper
President terms simultaneous polls ‘development-oriented’

NEW DELHI,Today's Paper ‘People showed their wisdom by delivering a clear verdict’ President Ram Nath Kovind on Thursday asked the Members of Parliament to seriously ponder over the proposal of simultaneous polls, terming it “development-oriented”.
In his hour-long address to both Houses of Parliament, he stated that the people of the country had “demonstrated their wisdom by delivering a clear verdict” in the 2019 Lok Sabha election.
Mr. Kovind also flagged the government’s move to push forward with the triple talaq Bill in this session, its decision to implement the National Register of Citizens (NRC) on a priority basis and strong response to terror after the attack in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir, on February 14. “‘One nation simultaneous election’ is the need of the hour, which would facilitate accelerated development, thereby benefiting our countrymen. With such a system in place, all political parties, according to their respective ideologies, will be able to better utilise their energy towards development and public welfare,” he said.
The government had taken steps to curb infiltration by deciding to implement the NRC, currently being updated in Assam, on a priority basis in areas affected by infiltration, the President said.
While the government was working to identify infiltrators, it was also fully committed to protecting those who were victims of persecution due to their faith in neighbouring countries, via the Citizenship Act, but that it would be amended to protect linguistic, cultural and social identities, he said.
The amendments to the Act were necessitated by huge protests in the northeastern region, particularly in Assam, early this year.
Tough on terror
Mr. Kovind commended the government for acting tough on terror after the Pulwama attack. “India has amply demonstrated both her intent and capabilities, first through surgical strikes and then through air strikes after Pulwama on terrorist hideouts across the border. In future too, all possible steps will be taken to ensure our security,” he said. The “whole world stands with India on the issue of terrorism, the designation of Masood Azhar, responsible for the dastardly terrorist attacks on our soil, as a global terrorist by the United Nations is a major testimony to this fact.”
UPA leader Sonia Gandhi was seen thumping her desk when the Balakot air strikes after Pulwama was mentioned by the President.
Mr. Kovind said India would host a G-20 summit in 2022, a sign of its “new image”.
The “eradication of social evils like triple talaq and nikah halala” was imperative and all members should cooperate in such efforts. The Union Cabinet had cleared a fresh bill on triple talaq and is expected to table it in this session of Parliament.
The President concluded his remarks by referring to Mahatma Gandhi’s talisman as a guiding principle for all MPs. “My advice to all MPs is that you should always remember the fundamental ‘mantra’ of Gandhiji. He had said that every decision of ours should be guided by its impact on the poorest and weakest person in society,” he said.

NEW DELHI: President Ram Nath Kovind on Thursday said a "very clear mandate" for the Narendra Modi government in the Lok Sabha polls was for continuing uninterrupted the development journey that it started in 2014, as he listed the government's achievements and goals.In an hour-long address to the joint sitting of Parliament, Kovind said national security was paramount for the government as he touched on surgical strikes and air strikes on Pakistan-based terror camps. Here is the full text of President Kovind's speech.Honourable Members,1. I am pleased to address the first joint sitting of Parliament after the election of the 17th Lok Sabha, in the year commemorating the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. I extend my heartiest congratulations to all newly elected Members of this Lok Sabha.2. More than 61 crore voters of the country set a new record by casting their votes and enhanced the credibility of India’s democracy in the world.
People have stood in long queues braving extreme heat to cast their votes. This time, as compared to previous elections, more women have cast their votes and their participation has been almost equal to men. Crores of youth have voted for the first time and played an important role in shaping India’s future. All voters deserve to be congratulated for the success of this election.3. I also convey my best wishes to the new Speaker of the Lok Sabha for this new responsibility.4. I congratulate the entire team of the Election Commission for successful completion of the world’s largest election. The contribution of employees of several administrative departments and various institutions, as well as the security forces in successful conduct of the electoral process is extremely praiseworthy.5. Nearly half of the MPs in this Lok Sabha have been elected for the first time. The election of 78 women MPs which is the highest number in the history of Lok Sabha, presents the picture of a New India.6. It is a matter of joy that the reflection of India’s diversity is visible in this joint sitting. People of every age, hailing from villages and cities, belonging to every profession, are members of both the Houses. Many members are associated with social service, many are from the field of agriculture, from business and economic sphere while other members are from the field of education, medical profession which saves the lives of people and legal profession which provides justice to the people. MPs who have made their mark in the world of cinema, art, literature and culture are also present here. I am confident that your unique experiences will contribute to enriching the discussions in Parliament.Honourable Members,7. The people of the country have given a very clear mandate in this election. After assessing the performance of the Government during the first tenure, the people have given even stronger support for the second term. By doing so, the people of the country have given a mandate for continuing uninterrupted and at an accelerated pace the journey of development which started in 2014.8. All fellow countrymen are familiar with the atmosphere prevailing in the country before 2014. In order to take the country out of a sense of gloom and instability, the people elected a Government with absolute majority after three decades. Giving the highest regard to that mandate, my Government started to march forward without any discrimination with the mantra of 'Sabka Saath- Sabka Vikas’, to create a New India.9. on January 31st this year, in this very Central Hall, I had said that my Government from the very first day was dedicated to the goal of improving the lives of all citizens, addressing their problems arising out of mis-governance and providing all basic amenities to the last person standing at the margins of society. 10. During the last five years, the countrymen have come to believe that the Government is always with them, working to improve their lives and to enhance their Ease of Living. Based on this wealth of people’s trust, a fresh mandate was sought.11. People of the country have long waited for the basic amenities of life. But now the conditions are changing. My Government wants to make the people conscious, capable, well-provided and unfettered to such an extent that that they do not feel the “Burden, Force, or Absence” of the Government in their daily life. Empowering every person in the country is the main goal of my Government.Honourable Members,12. My Government is committed to that very idea of nation-building, the foundation for which was laid in 2014. While fulfilling the basic needs of the countrymen, now the Government is moving forward towards realising their aspirations of building a Strong, Safe, Prosperous and All-inclusive India. This journey is inspired by the basic spirit of 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas aur Sabka Vishwas’.This New India’s vision is motivated by the noble thoughts of Shri Narayana Guru Kerala’s great spiritual figure, social reformer and poet: “Jaati-Bhedam Mat-Dwesham AdumIlladey Sarvrum Sodar-tvain Vaadunn Matrukasthan Maanit”That is, an ideal place is one where people live like brothers free from the discrimination of caste and religion.13. Three weeks ago, on 30th May, immediately after swearing-in the Government has started working towards building a New India. A New India: - Where equal opportunities to progress are available to every person; - Where life of every person becomes better and their self-esteem is enhanced; - Where brotherhood and harmony bind the people with each other; - Where the foundation built on our ideals and values becomes stronger; and - Where the benefits of development reach every region and the last person standing in the queue.This New India, will move forward towards that ideal state envisioned by Gurudev Rabindra Nath Tagore, where the mind of the people is without fear and the head is held high with self-esteem. In Gurudev’s words: “Chitto Jetha Bhay-Shunno, Uchcho Jetha Shir.”Honourable Members,14. It is a matter of pride for every Indian that when our country completes 75 years of independence in 2022, we would have achieved many national goals for building a New India. To pave the way for the golden future of New India, my Government has resolved:On this path of a New India, the rural India will be strong and urban India will also be empowered;On this path of a New India, the entrepreneurial India will attain new heights and the dreams of young India will also be fulfilled;On this path of a New India, all systems will be transparent and the prestige of honest countrymen will increase further;On this path of a New India, infrastructure for the 21st century will be built and all resources for creation of a powerful India will be mobilised.In the light of these resolutions, in a short period of 21 days, my Government has taken many decisions aimed at the welfare of farmers, soldiers, students, entrepreneurs, women and other sections of society and have also started implementing them. Initiatives have also been taken to enact several new laws.15. A decision has been taken to increase the income support to farmers who are our Annadaata, by extending the coverage under 'Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi’, to every farmer in the country. To enable the farmer brothers and sisters who work day and night in their fields to lead a respectable life after attaining the age of 60 years, a 'Pension Scheme’ for them has also been approved.16. Livestock is invaluable for farmers. They have to spend a lot of money for treatment of cattle-related diseases. To reduce this expenditure, my Government has also decided to start a special scheme with an allocation of Rs 13,000 crore.17. For the first time, a Government has taken note of the economic security of small shopkeepers. In the very first meeting of the Cabinet, a separate 'Pension Scheme’ has been approved for small shopkeepers and retail traders. About 3 crore small shopkeepers in the country will benefit from this scheme.18. We are all indebted to the soldiers who dedicate themselves to protect the countrymen by sacrificing every joy, every pleasure and every festive occasion. It is our duty to secure the future of children of those who guard the border, and ensure peace and security for everyone. Inspired by this sentiment, the amount of scholarship under the 'National Defence Fund’ has been increased for the children of our brave soldiers. For the first time, sons and daughters of the State police personnel have also been included in this scholarship.Honourable Members,19. One of the biggest challenges of the 21st century is – the growing water crisis. Over time, the traditional and effective practices of water conservation in our country are disappearing. Houses have come up over ponds and lakes, and the vanishing water sources have accentuated the water crisis for the poor. In view of the growing impact of Climate Change and Global Warming, water crisis is likely to aggravate further. Today, the need of the hour is that the way the country has shown seriousness about 'Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan’, the same seriousness be shown in 'Water Conservation and Management’.20. We must conserve water for our children and future generations. The creation of the new 'Ministry of Jalshakti’ is a decisive step in this direction, which will have far-reaching benefits. Through this new Ministry, the systems related to water conservation and management will be made more effective.21. My Government is fully conscious of the crisis in the drought-hit areas and stands by every affected citizen. With the support of State Governments and Sarpanches at the village level, it is being ensured that farmers are assisted and the scarcity of drinking water is tackled.22. Strengthening the system and spirit of Co-operative Federalism, my Government is taking the States along to achieve the national goals. Last week, important developmental issues were discussed with the Chief Ministers and a decision was taken to constitute a Committee of Chief Ministers to look into Structural Reforms in the field of agriculture.Honourable Members,23. Only on the foundation of a strong rural economy, it is possible to build a strong national economy. Our farmers are the pillars of rural economy. All possible efforts are being made by the Central Government to provide adequate assistance to the States for agricultural development.24. Large scale investments have been made to strengthen rural India. In order to enhance agriculture productivity, an investment of Rs. 25 lakh crore will be made in the coming years.25. To double the income of farmers by 2022, several steps have been taken in the last 5 years. Be it the decision to increase the MSP, or approval for 100 percent FDI in food processing; be it completion of the irrigation projects pending for decades or extension of 'Crop Insurance Scheme’; be it the 'Soil Health Card’ or 100% Neem coating of urea; my Government has taken many decisions, appreciating such numerous small and big needs of the farmers. The Government has made the agriculture policy both production-centric as well as income-centric.26. An important link in these efforts is 'Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi’. Through this, an amount of more than Rs. 12,000 crore has been disbursed to the farmers in just three months. An estimated expenditure of Rs. 90,000 crore is likely to be incurred annually on this scheme since every farmer has now been brought in its ambit.27. With the provision of storage for farm produce, the economic security of the farmers is strengthened. Now the storage facility will be provided to the farmers near their village through the 'Grameen Bhandaran Yojana’.28. The benefit of cooperatives in the agriculture sector is being availed by the farmers in the dairy business. In other areas of agriculture also, the target is to create 10,000 new 'Farmer Producer Organisations’ to benefit the farmers.29. Today, India is second in the world in fish production. Our country has the potential to attain the first place. There is immense potential for increasing the income of farmers through marine fish industry and inland fisheries. That is why the Government is committed to 'Neeli Kranti’ which means 'Blue Revolution’. A separate Department has been constituted for integrated development of fisheries. Similarly, a special fund has been created to develop infrastructure related to fishing industry.Honourable Members,30. We can achieve our constitutional objectives only by liberating the poor families of the country from poverty. During the last five years, the schemes implemented in the country for the welfare of farmers, labourers, divyangjan, tribals and women have achieved wide spread success. Only by empowering the poor can they be rescued from the vicious cycle of poverty. That is why the Government has adopted an approach to empower the poor, deprived and weaker sections through provision of housing, healthcare, essential amenities of life, financial inclusion, education, skill and self-employment. This is in harmony with Deen Dayal Upadhyaya’s concept of Antyodaya.31. Comprehensive work is underway for the development of112 'Aspirational Districts’ in the country. 1 lakh 15 thousand most backward villages of the country are in these districts. With the development of education and healthcare facilities and infrastructure in these villages, there will be a positive impact on the lives of crores of poor families.32. After the success of the world’s largest financial inclusion campaign, in the form of 'Jan-Dhan Yojana’, my Government is also working to bring the banking services to the doorsteps of the people. In order to ensure that banking services are readily available in every village of the country and in the inaccessible areas of North East, work is being done at a fast pace. About 1.5 lakh post offices in the country are being prepared to provide banking services through 'India Post Payment Bank’. Our goal is to utilise the postman as a mobile bank to bring banking services to every doorstep.Honourable Members,33. Cost of medical treatment pushes the poor families into financial crisis. In order to protect them from this crisis, world’s biggest healthcare scheme 'Ayushman Bharat Yojana’ has been implemented, providing 'Health-Protection-Cover’ to 50 crore poor people. Under this, so far about 26 lakh poor patients have availed treatment in hospitals. In order to provide medicines at affordable rates, 5,300 'Jan Aushadhi Kendras’ have also been opened. It is our endeavour to provide medicines at affordable rates to people residing in far-flung areas through these Jan Aushadhi Kendras.34. The objective is to set up about 1.5 lakh 'Health and Wellness Centres’ in all rural areas by 2022. So far, about 18,000 such Centres have already been operationalised.35. Our countrymen can learn a lot from tribal communities. Our tribal brothers and sisters live in harmony with the environment and nature and maintain a beautiful balance between development and tradition. In New India, every effort will be made to create an inclusive and sensitive system in the interest of tribal communities. Many schemes have been implemented for all-round development of tribal areas. Work is in progress to provide 'Learning to Earning’ facilities to the youth residing in the forest areas. In tribal dominated areas, 'Eklavya Model Residential Schools’ are being set up for children. The thrust is on value addition and marketing of forest produce through Van Dhan Kendras.Honourable Members,36. Women Empowerment is one of the top priorities of my Government. Empowerment of women and their effective involvement in society and economy is the touchstone of a developed society. The Government’s thinking promotes not only women’s development but also women-led development. According the highest priority to women’s security, several effective steps have been initiated with the cooperation of the States. Penalties for crimes against women have been made harsher and the new penal provisions are being strictly enforced. The 'Beti Bachao Beti Padhao’ campaign has brought down female foeticide and improved the sex ratio in many districts of the country.37. Rural women are the biggest beneficiaries of freedom from smoke through 'Ujjwala Yojana’, vaccination through 'Mission Indradhanush’ and free electricity connections under 'Saubhagya’ Yojana. Women are also being given priority in the registration of houses built under 'Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana’ in the rural areas. Under this scheme, nearly 2 crore new houses will be built in the villages during the next three years.38. Facilities for the women workers in the unorganized sector are also being augmented. Self-employment opportunities are being made available to rural women through 'Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Rashtriya Aajivika Mission. Under the 'Rashtriya Aajivika Mission’, loans amounting to more than Rs 2 lakh crore have been disbursed so far to 3 crore women in rural areas.39. My Government is committed to make women equal stakeholders in the country’s development and prosperity. Efforts will be made in collaboration with industry and corporate sector to provide better employment opportunities to women. In addition, in Government procurement, priority will be given to those enterprises where women’s participation in the workforce is more than the prescribed limit.40. To secure equal rights for every sister and daughter in the country, eradication of social evils like 'Triple Talaq’ and 'Nikah-Halala’ is imperative. I would urge all the members to cooperate in these efforts to make the lives of our sisters and daughters better and dignified.Honourable Members,41. Our young generation must have a meaningful participation in the building of New India. In the last five years, attempts have been made for developing the skills of the youth, providing them financial support for start-ups and self-employment, and making available adequate number of seats for higher education. The amount of scholarship has also been increased by 25 per cent.42. The Government has made provision of 10 per cent reservation for youth from economically weaker section of the general category. This will enable them to get more opportunities in employment and education.43. To enable the youth of all strata of society to fulfil their dreams, timely provision of financial resources is being emphasised. The impact of 'Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojna’ has been felt on a big scale. Under this scheme, about 19 crore loans have been disbursed for self-employment. An effort will now be made to cover 30 crore people by expanding this scheme. A facility for entrepreneurs to avail loan up to Rs. 50 lakh without any guarantee will also be introduced. Apart from this, new employment opportunities will be generated through appropriate policies in sectors which have the potential to accelerate the economy.44. Today India has joined the league of countries with most number of start-ups in the world. To improve the start-up ecosystem, the Government is simplifying the rules. This campaign will be further expedited. Our goal is to establish 50,000 start-ups in the country by 2024.45. Research is being encouraged in higher educational institutions. To further strengthen this effort, it is proposed to establish a 'National Research Foundation’. This proposed foundation will work as a bridge between different Departments of the Central Government, science laboratories, higher educational institutions and industrial institutions.46. To enable various higher educational institutions of India to find a place in the top 500 educational institutions of the world, they are being encouraged through grant of autonomy and financial assistance.47. My Government is striving to increase the number of seats in the country’s Higher Education System by one-and-a-half times by 2024. With this initiative, 2 crore additional seats would be available for the youth in higher educational institutions.Honourable Members,48. It is our responsibility to provide appropriate opportunities, environment and quality education to enhance the talent of children. In this regard, the 'Pradhan Mantri Innovative Learning Programme’ will be started.49. In order to attract children early enough, at the school level, towards technology, suitable infrastructure is being created. Through the 'Atal Innovation Mission’, the work of establishing 'Atal Tinkering Labs’ in about 9,000 schools across the country, is progressing rapidly. Similarly, 'Atal Incubation Centres’ are being set up in 102 universities and other institutions.50. Impressive performance in sports competitions at the world level, enhances the pride of the country as well as increases the interest of children and youth in sports. It also strengthens the culture of according primacy to health in life. To make India a global sports powerhouse, it is important that talented players living in far-flung areas of the country are identified and their selection process is made transparent. To identify the players at the state and district level, it has been decided to widen the 'Khelo-India Programme’. Under this, 2,500 talented players have been selected, and are being trained. Now this facility will be provided to 2,500 new players every year.51. The sports infrastructure in the country will be modernised as well as expanded. A new system is being evolved to make available modern infrastructure and facilities to the players. It is our endeavour that our players win high accolades in the sports world and enhance the prestige of our country.Honourable Members,52. Economic development plays the most vital role in improving the lives of our countrymen. Today India is among the fastest growing economies in the world. Inflation is low, fiscal deficit is under control, foreign exchange reserves are growing and the impact of Make In India is clearly visible.53. India is now on the way to become the world’s 5th largest economy in terms of GDP. To maintain the high growth rate, reform process will continue. It is our objective to make India a 5-trillion dollar economy by 2024.54. Work is underway in full earnest to transform India into a Global Manufacturing Hub. Keeping in view Industry 4.0, a New Industrial Policy will be announced shortly. In 'Ease of Doing Business’, India has leap-frogged 65 positions during the past 5 years, from a ranking of 142 in 2014 to 77. Now our goal is to be among the top 50 countries of the world. In order to achieve this, process of simplification of rules will be further expedited in collaboration with the States. In this sequence, necessary amendments are also being brought in the Companies Law.55. Taxation regime plays an important role in accelerating economic development. Along with continuous reform, simplification of taxation system is also being emphasised. Exemption to persons earning up to Rs. 5 lakh from payment of income tax is an important step in this direction. 56. Similarly, indirect tax system is also being made simple and effective. With the implementation of GST, the concept of 'One country, One tax, One market’ has become a reality. Efforts to further simplify the GST will continue. 57. Keeping in view the interests of small traders, my Government has launched a New Pension Scheme for them. 'National Traders Welfare Board’ will be constituted shortly, and 'National Retail Trade Policy’ will be formulated to promote retail business. Accident insurance of up to Rs. 10 lakh will also be provided to all traders registered under GST.58. MSME sector provides a strong foundation to the country’s economy, and plays a critical role in employment generation. Several steps have been taken to ensure smooth cash flow to enterprises run by small entrepreneurs. In order to ensure that entrepreneurs associated with MSME sector do not face any problem in accessing credit, the credit guarantee coverage is being enhanced to Rs. 1 lakh crore.Honourable Members,59. Good governance reduces corruption, enhances self-respect of the citizens and enables them to optimally utilize their talents and capabilities.60. My Government will make the Zero Tolerance Policy against corruption more comprehensive and effective. The mission to eliminate corruption from public life and Government services will be implemented with greater zeal. Towards this objective, Minimum Government - Maximum Governance will be further emphasised. In addition, use of technology will be maximised to reduce Human Interface. Appointment of Lokpal will also promote transparency.61. The campaign against black money will be taken forward at a faster pace. During the last two years, 4 lakh 25 thousand Company Directors have been disqualified and the registration of 3 lakh 50 thousand suspicious companies has been revoked.62. The 'Fugitive and Economic Offenders Act’ has proved effective in controlling fugitive economic offenders. Now we are receiving information in this regard from 146 countries, including Switzerland. Of these, we have concluded agreements with 80 countries for automatic exchange of information. We are now receiving information about all those who have stashed black money abroad.63. The impact of 'Real Estate Regulation Act’ or RERA is clearly visible in curbing black money transactions in real estate sector and protecting the interests of the customers; providing huge relief to the middle class families.64. 'Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code’ is among the biggest and most impactful economic reforms undertaken in the country. With the coming into force of this Code, banks and other financial institutions have been able to settle directly or indirectly an amount of more than Rs. 3 lakh 50 thousand crore. This Code has also curbed the tendency of wilfully defaulting on loans taken from banks and other financial institutions.65. Under the 'Direct Benefit Transfer’, funds from more than400 schemes are being directly credited into the accounts of beneficiaries. During the last five years, Rs. 7 lakh 30 thousand crore have been transferred through DBT. So far, not only has DBT prevented Rs. 1 lakh 41 thousand crore from falling into wrong hands, but it has also enabled deletion of names of about 8 crore ineligible beneficiaries. DBT will be further expanded in the coming days. I would urge the State Governments to use DBT in more and more schemes.Honourable Members,66. Infrastructure will play an important role in ushering in a prosperous India. My Government’s continuous endeavour has been to build infrastructure in an eco-friendly manner. Along with concrete, greenery has been made an integral part of the highway and expressway projects. For supply of electricity, optimal utilisation of solar energy is being stressed. Household and industrial wastes are also being used in road construction.67. In the 21st century economy, the pace and spread of urbanization will continue to increase. Development of urban infrastructure in cities and suburbs will pave the way for economic progress and enhance employment opportunities. My Government is tirelessly working for a modern India, by providing world-class infrastructure and public amenities in villages as well as cities. Special emphasis is being accorded to improving connectivity in the North-East, hilly and tribal areas. In addition to increasing the ease of living of citizens in the North-East; tourism, agriculture and other allied sectors will also benefit from better connectivity. Effective steps are being taken to expand organic farming in the North-East.68. Under the 'Bharatmala Project’, construction or upgradation of about 35,000 kilometers of National Highways is to be undertaken by 2022. In addition, under the 'Sagarmala Project’, a network of good quality roads is being constructed in coastal areas and areas adjoining ports. 69. Along with the highways, Government is also working extensively in the area of Railways, Airways and Inland Waterways. Under the 'UDAN Scheme’, air connectivity to smaller towns is being expanded rapidly. 70. Urban transport infrastructure is being created to cater to present and future requirements. While developing infrastructure, attention is also being given to addressing the challenges posed by pollution. My Government is developing a transport system, which is not only fast and safe, but is also environment friendly. For this, special emphasis is given to Public transport. Metro rail network is being expanded rapidly in several cities. The facility of 'One Nation, One Card’ has been launched to realize the dream of seamless mobility. Similarly, electric vehicles are being promoted to reduce vehicular pollution. The network of electric charging stations is also being expanded rapidly.71. Modern amenities like gas-grid and I-Ways are being developed at a rapid pace. PNG based domestic fuel and CNG based transportation systems are being developed. In modern India, we are according a special emphasis on production of bio-fuel. Prior to 2014, about 67 crore litres of ethanol was being blended. This year, we have set a target of about 270 crore litres for ethanol blending. Enhancing the use of blended ethanol will not only benefit our farmers but also safeguard the environment. Further, it will reduce import of petroleum products thus saving foreign exchange.Honourable Members,72. My Government is fully devoted to make the flow of Ganga uninterrupted and pollution free. Recently, encouraging evidence of revival of aquatic life at several locations along Ganga have been reported. This year, during the Ardhakumbh in Prayagraj, the cleanliness of Ganga and amenities provided to the devotees have made news throughout the world. My Government has enhanced the dignity and self-esteem of every person who contributed towards the successful organization of Ardhakumbh by honouring them.73. Under the 'Namami Gange’ scheme, my Government will further accelerate the campaign for closure of drains releasing effluents in the river Ganga. On the lines of river Ganga, the Government will also endeavour to clean up other rivers such as Kaveri, Periyar, Narmada, Yamuna, Mahanadi and Godavari.74. My Government is making earnest efforts for conservation of forests, wildlife and the environment. In recent years, forest and tree cover has increased by more than 1 per cent. During the last five years, protected areas in the country have also increased. In 2014, the number of protected areas in the country was 692, which has now gone up to 868. To address the challenges posed by air pollution, 'National Clean Air Programme’ has been started in 102 cities.75. Solar energy plays an important role in reducing the adverse effects of Climate Change and Global Warming. Proactive efforts of India have resulted in the formation of the International Solar Alliance. Through this organization, India is contributing significantly to the development of solar energy in the developing countries of the world.Honourable Members,76. Space Technology plays a central role in improving the lives of the common man, providing early-warning of impending disasters, identifying location of natural resources, providing signals to various means of communication and ensuring national security. It is the endeavour of my Government to maximize the use of space technology for human welfare. Several facilities such as roads, houses for poor, farming or equipment for fishermen have all been linked to space technology.77. Space technology has helped us in further strengthening our security at land, air and water. Our expertise in accurate weather forecast has improved. This was evidenced during the recent 'Cyclone Phani' that struck the eastern coast of the country. Due to accurate information and timely preparation, large scale destruction to life and property was averted.78. India is marching forward to assume a leadership role in unravelling and comprehending the mysteries of space. Our scientists are involved in the preparations for the launch of 'Chandrayaan-2’, which will be India’s first spacecraft to reach the Moon. We are also making rapid progress towards achieving the goal of sending the first Indian in India’s own 'Gaganyaan’ by 2022.79. During the Lok Sabha elections, the country attained another milestone, which however, did not receive as much attention as it should have. With the successful testing of 'Mission Shakti’ a new dimension has been added to India’s capability in space technology and security-preparedness. For this, today I once again congratulate our scientists and engineers.80. The role of technology in the field of security is expanding continuously. Keeping this in view, work is in progress to establish three joint service agencies for space, cyber and special forces. These collaborative efforts will strengthen the security of the country.Honourable Members,81. New India is rapidly moving towards occupying its rightful place in the world community. Today, India has acquired a new image and our relations with other countries have become stronger. It is a matter of immense pleasure that in 2022, India will host the G-20 Summit.82. The world community enthusiastically supported India’s proposal to declare June 21st as 'International Day of Yoga’ by the United Nations. At present, several programmes associated with International Day of Yoga are being organized with great enthusiasm in various countries, of which the most important events will be held tomorrow, the 21st June.83. The world community supports India’s position on various issues such as climate change, economic and cyber-crime, action against corruption and black money and energy security. Today the whole world stands with India on the issue of terrorism. Designation of Masood Azhar, responsible for dastardly terrorist attacks on our soil, as a global terrorist by United Nations, is a major testimony to this fact.84. My Government’s “Neighborhood First” policy is an evidence of our approach of according priority to South Asia and countries in the adjoining region. India will play a crucial role in the progress of this region. Accordingly, trade, connectivity and people-to-people contact are being encouraged in this region. The presence of Heads of States and Heads of Governments of 'BIMSTEC’ countries, Kyrgyzstan – the current chair of 'Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’ and Mauritius during the swearing-in of the new Government is a reflection of this policy.85. My Government is also conscious of protecting the interests of Indians living and working abroad. Today an Indian, if caught in any crisis abroad, is confident of receiving timely help and relief. Several services ranging from passports to visas have been made easy and accessible.86. Due to the efforts of my Government, India’s philosophy, culture and achievements have got a distinct recognition at the global stage. This year, the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, which is being celebrated world over, will provide a fillip to India’s 'Thought Leadership’. Similarly, programmes related to the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev ji, will help spread the light of India’s spiritual wisdom throughout the world.Honourable Members,87. New India will be sensitive and also, economically prosperous. But for this to happen, nation’s security is of utmost importance. My Government accords top most priority to national security. Therefore, effective steps are being taken to tackle Terrorism and Naxalism.88. India has amply demonstrated both her intent and capabilities, first through surgical strikes and then through air strikes after the Pulwama attack at terrorist hideouts across the border. In future too, all possible steps will be taken to ensure our security.89. Illegal infiltrators pose a major threat to our internal security. This is leading to social imbalance in many parts of the country, as well as putting a huge pressure on limited livelihood opportunities. My Government has decided to implement the process of 'National Register of Citizens’ on priority basis in areas affected by infiltration. Security along the border will be further strengthened to prevent infiltration.90. While on the one hand, Government is working to identify the infiltrators, on the other, it is also fully committed to protecting the victims of persecution due to their faith. In this regard, efforts will be made to amend the Citizenship Act while protecting the linguistic, cultural and social identities.91. My Government is making efforts with complete dedication to provide a safe and peaceful environment to the residents of Jammu and Kashmir. The recently concluded peaceful elections to local bodies and to Lok Sabha have bolstered our efforts. My Government is committed to take all necessary steps for the development of Jammu and Kashmir.92. My Government is resolutely working to eradicate the menace of Naxalism from the country. Considerable success has been achieved in this direction during the last 5 years. The area affected by Naxalism is reducing continuously. In the coming years, development projects will be expedited in these areas, which will benefit our tribal brothers and sisters residing there.Honourable Members,93. My Government is rapidly taking forward the work of modernisation of the army and the armed forces. India is going to receive the delivery of first 'Rafale’ fighter aircraft and 'Apache’ helicopters in the near future.94. Special emphasis is being accorded by the Government to manufacture of modern armaments under 'Make in India’. The policy of indigenously manufacturing weapons such as modern rifles and cannons, tanks and combat aircrafts is being carried forward successfully. 'Defence Corridors’ coming up in Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu will further strengthen this mission. While fulfilling our security requirements, export of defence equipment is also being encouraged.95. Respect towards soldiers and martyrs enhances self-respect and enthusiasm among the forces, and also strengthens our military capabilities. Hence, all possible efforts are being made to take care of our soldiers and their families. Through 'One Rank One Pension’, increased pensionary benefits to ex-service men and expansion of health facilities, efforts are being made to improve their living standards.96. The National War Memorial near India Gate in Delhi, built by my Government, seven decades after India’s independence, is a tribute to the martyrs by a grateful nation. Similarly my Government has set up the 'National Police Memorial’ in memory of police personnel who were martyred while safeguarding the security of the country.Honourable Members,97. Inspiration from history guides us towards the future path of nation building. It is our duty to preserve the memory of our nation-builders and gratefully remember them. There have been many such efforts during the last five years. 'Dandi Museum’ has been built to honour Pujya Bapu and the historic Dandi March. “Statue of Unity”, the tallest statue in the world, has been built as a mark of our gratitude to the Iron Man, Sardar Patel. 'Kranti Mandir’ has been set up at the Red Fort in Delhi, as a tribute to Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose and other freedom fighters of Azad Hind Fauj. 26 Alipur Road in Delhi, the site of Babasaheb Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar’s Mahaparinirvana has been developed as a National Memorial. A museum is also being built in Delhi as a mark of respect to the contributions of all former Prime Ministers of the country.98. My Government, inspired by Sardar Patel, is committed to further strengthen the spirit of 'Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat’. For this, it is essential to accord importance to National Ambitions and Regional Aspirations. All forms of dialogue and cooperation will be encouraged to achieve this. Guided by the principle of 'Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas aur Sabka Vishwas’, it is the endeavour of my Government to ensure that no citizen is left behind in India’s journey of development.Honourable Members,99. India had to pass through a long period of subjugation. But throughout this period, Indians kept fighting for independence in different parts of the country. The longing for freedom and willingness to make sacrifices to achieve freedom had never waned. This desire for independence culminated into the 'Quit India Movement’ in 1942, when the entire nation was determined to achieve independence and even to sacrifice their lives in this cause. Contributing to the freedom struggle was the only thought behind all the actions of our countrymen. We achieved our independence in 1947 on the strength of this collective spirit.100. Today, all of us are again at a juncture of creating history. We are striving to launch a new movement for ushering in a new era. Our resolve today will determine the shape of the India of 2047 when we celebrate the centenary of our independence.101. Today, our country is enriched with the experiences of a 72-year journey since independence. The nation is moving ahead only by learning from these experiences. All of us have to move ahead with the resolve to realise the idea of New India by the year 2022 when we celebrate the 75th anniversary of India’s independence. Thus, in the New India in the 75th year of its independence: - Farmers’ income will be doubled; - Every poor will have a pucca roof over his head; - Every poor will have access to clean fuel; - Every poor will have electricity connection; - No poor will be compelled to defecate in the open; - Every poor will have access to medical facilities; - Every village in the country will be connected by roads; - River Ganga will flow uninterrupted, and pollution free; - In collaboration with States, India will be close to becoming a $ 5 trillion economy; - We will be progressing towards joining world’s three largest economies; - An Indian will unfurl the tri-colour in space, entirely on the strength of indigenous resources; and - We will provide leadership to global development with a new zeal and confidence.Honourable Members,102. If the gap between the public and the Government is reduced, and public partnership is ensured, our countrymen can transform Government schemes and programmes into mass movements. This is the way forward to achieve transformative national goals. Adopting this approach, programmes like the 'Beti-Bachao, Beti-Padhao’, and 'Swachh Bharat Abhiyan’ evolved into mass movements. On the strength of people’s participation, we will also achieve the objective of a New India.Honourable Members,103. It is the belief of my Government that political parties, States and 130 crore countrymen are all committed to India’s integrated and accelerated development. Our vibrant democracy has also matured adequately. During the last few decades, due to frequent elections being held in some part of the country or the other, the pace and continuity of development programmes have been impacted. Our countrymen have demonstrated their wisdom by delivering a clear verdict both at State and National issues. 'One Nation – Simultaneous Elections’ is the need of the hour, which would facilitate accelerated development, thereby benefitting our countrymen. With such a system in place, all political parties, according to their respective ideologies, will be able to better utilise their energy towards development and public welfare. Therefore, I urge all Members of Parliament to seriously ponder over this development oriented proposal of 'One Nation - Simultaneous Elections’.Honourable Members,104. This year also marks 70 years of adoption of the Indian Constitution. As a Member of Parliament, all of you have undertaken the oath or affirmation to discharge your duties with true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India. The Constitution is paramount to all of us. The chief architect of our Constitution, BabasahebDr. Bhimrao Ambedkar had said that 'we must hold fast to constitutional methods of achieving our social and economic objectives’.105. Our Constitution provides guidance for ensuring social, economic and political justice as well as securing liberty and equality for all citizens; and promote fraternity among all, assuring the dignity of the individual.106. I believe that you all Members of the Rajya Sabha and the Lok Sabha, as parliamentarians, will make invaluable contributions in achieving the ideals of the Constitution while discharging your duties. In this way, you will contribute effectively in ushering in a New India.107. All of us will have to accord priority to our duties as public representatives and as citizens of the country. Only then will we be able to inspire countrymen to discharge their duties as citizens.108. My advice to all MPs is that you should always remember the fundamental mantra of Gandhiji. He had said that every decision of ours should be guided by its impact on the poorest and the weakest person in the society. You must also remember the voter who setting aside all his work and overcoming his difficulties went to the polling station to cast his vote and discharge his responsibilities towards the nation. Your priority should be to fulfil his aspirations.109. I urge you all to dedicate yourselves in the task of building a New India and to discharge your duties with utmost sincerity over the next five years. I once again wish the very best to all of you.Jai Hind!(Source: http://pib.gov.in[http://pib.gov.in])

Lack of Strategic Consistency
PAVAN K VARMA

Srinagar, June 20 -- Should India talk to Pakistan? The conventional view is that we should not as long as Pakistan continues to sponsor terrorism against India. This is the policy, it appears, that we are following now. Pakistan was not invited for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's swearing-in ceremony on May 30. We have not responded to Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan's appeasing messages for the commencement of talks. Mr Modi did not accept Pakistan's offer to relax the no-fly zone over its territory for his journey to Bishkek. And, at the Shanghai Cooperation Summit (SCO) there, no meeting - formal or informal - took place between the two leaders.
Given Pakistan's verifiable complicity in the unabated terrorist attacks against India, especially the most recent Pulwama attack, our stern approach is correct. The message must go across firmly to Pakistan that talks and terrorism cannot go together. Pakistan must be hoping that - as so many times in the past - India will opt to forgive and forget, and move on towards the restoration of normalcy. Such a soft approach only emboldens Pakistan to continue with its finely tuned policy of explosive aggression followed by tactical appeasement. We need to short-circuit this deadly syndrome, and only a consistent hard line can hope to achieve that.
This being said, must the leaders of two neighbouring countries behave like petulant children who make a spectacle of their hostility even in company? At the SCO meet in Bishkek, Imran Khan and Narendra Modi did not even greet each other for the most part of the two-day summit (and only briefly exchanged pleasantries and shook hands at the end), while Russia's Vladimir Putin and China's Xi Jinping and a dozen other leaders from other countries looked on. While our policy on no structured talks or preplanned formal - or even informal - summit meetings may be right, do we have to stretch this to a lack of basic manners that is the protocol even between confirmed adversaries?
The significant point is that state craftsmanship is about deliberative policymaking, not tantrums. To talk or not to talk is a decision that has to be embedded in a strategic matrix, with all its short-term and long-term consequences factored in and anticipated. In this exercise, the only north star of policy formulation is the national interest. If the national interest is served by talks, we should talk. If it is not, we should not. But, a decision in this regard should be taken by a systemic, ruthless, unemotional analysis of the pros and cons of a decision either way.
To my understanding of Chanakyan politics, talks or no talks are not an end in themselves, but a means to an end. That end is the national interest. Chanakya himself preferred a mix of policy alternatives, famously summed up in his fourfold policy of sama, dama, danda, bheda - reconciliation, inducement, punishment and subversion. There is also a fifth - but lesser known - policy option called asana, which is the strategic art of deliberately sitting on the fence. Enlightened foreign policy means the art of picking one of the options from this bouquet of choices, or using several together as part of strategically meticulous planning. Our airstrike on Balakote was a very good example of danda. Our not responding to Pakistani overtures for talks is a continuation of that policy.
Can we continue the policy of danda forever? In some ways yes, if we continue to do a Balakote every time there is terrorist aggression on the scale of Pulwama from across the border. But by simplistically treating Pakistan as an untouchable in every circumstance and every occasion, are we reducing the efficacy of danda, besides giving Pakistan brownie points on the international stage as the country wanting to have better relations with India. The world is concerned about two nuclear weapons states being perpetually on a short fuse.
A sensible policy would be to have talks on our terms and agenda at a time of our choosing. The agenda should have terrorism at the very top of the list. This will convey to the world that India is amenable to better relations, albeit on conditions, which are - given Pakistan's verifiable record in sponsoring terrorism - eminently reasonable. If Pakistan chooses not to agree, so be it. Let us persist with this policy, so that Pakistan is left with no doubt that we mean business. But let us be ready that if Pakistan agrees to talks on our terms, the talks do not deviate, or get unintentionally amplified, to include other issues that are subsidiary to the primary one of terrorism.
At the same time, we should consider, at the appropriate time, the strategic utility of two-track diplomacy, or back-channel talks, with the right interlocutors in Pakistan. Such talks will have to be with the Deep State in that country, consisting of the Army and the ISI. Pakistan's economy is in deep trouble. There are limitations to which a country that is sinking in debt can maintain or sustain permanent war-preparedness. The policy of sama should kick in with a planned outreach to those constituencies in Pakistan that benefit from a peace dividend. Simultaneously, concerted diplomatic effort to isolate Pakistan on the question of terrorism should continue, as indeed, Prime Minister Modi did in Bishkek.
What we don't need is adhocism or lack of strategic consistency, wherein one day our PM makes an unplanned halt in Lahore to wish the Pakistan PM on his birthday, and the next day doesn't even greet his successor. Chanakya taught us that emotionalism and strategic planning, and impulsiveness and long-term policy formulation, are like oil and water - they just do not mix. Meanwhile, I think we should rethink our current stance of not even exchanging greetings or making eye contact with Pakistani leaders at international gatherings. Diplomacy is about policy, not the truculence of schoolchildren. Illiterate hardliners may cheer, but there is something unedifying in this kind of behaviour between two neighbouring countries, whatever the problems between them. Diplomacy sanctions resoluteness, not a lack of essential social graces.

Anantnag fidayeen attack: 'Militants used made-in-China steel ammo to penetrate bullet-proof shields'

Copyright 2019. The Kashmir Monitor
Srinagar, June 20 -- An internal investigation into the Anantnag fidayeen attack has revealed that the militants had used Chinese made steel bullets to pierce through the bullet-proof shields in a bid to inflict maximum casualties on the security forces.
On June 12, a joint patrolling party of CRPF's 116 battalion and police was attacked by a motor cycle borne militant killing five CRPF personnel, at KP road in Anantnag district. SHO Saddar Police Station Arshad Ahmad Khan, who was grievously injured in the attack, succumbed two days later at New Delhi's AIIMS. A foreign militant was also killed and one AK 47 riffle was recovered from his possession.
An investigation into the incident has now revealed that China made bullets were fired by the militant from his AK-47 rifle.
Sources said that rounds of steel bullets were recovered from the encounter site, which after a "thorough investigation" were found to have been made in China.
A top CRPF officer said wounds caused by the steel bullets were found on the bodies of slain CRPF personnel. "These bullets had pierced through the bullet-proof shield," he said.
The officer noted that the use of such ammunition was a cause of worry for the security forces. "We have apprised our top brass about the new bullets acquired by the militants. We will take all available measures to deal with this new threat. We are also probing how the militants got access to such weaponry," he said.
Sources said the use of such ammunition by the militants has set the alarm bells ringing considering the use of the bullet proof vehicles for the VIP security.
It is not for the first time that militants have used steel bullets to penetrate bullet proof shields of the security forces. In December 2017 Jaish-e-Mohammedmilitants had used steel bullets when they carried out a suicide attack on CRPF camp at Lethpora in South Kashmir. One of the five slain CRPF soldiers was hit by steel bullets which pierced through a static bullet-proof shield.
Later a thorough enquiry confirmed that the bullets fired by the militants from the AK rifle was made of steel core, which has the capability of piercing through the static bunkers used by security personnel during encounters.
The findings also showed that the bullet, which is mainly termed as Armour Piercing (AP), was made of hardened steel or tungsten carbide.
Earlier in March, this year, an American M4 carbine sniper rifle was also recovered from an encounter site in south Kashmir's Tral area.

Srinagar, June 20 -- Asserting that his administration has "disrupted" militant infrastructure in Jammu and Kashmir, Governor Satya Pal Malik on Wednesday said that Pakistan is "duty-bound" to share intelligence inputs about militant attacks with the Government of India.
However, in an apparent jibe, the Governor said "it needs to be seen how many attacks Pakistan is able to stop on its own soil."
"Pakistan is duty-bound to share intelligence inputs with us. But it also needs to be seen how many attacks are they (Pakistan) able to stop on its own soil,' Malik said at a police function in SKICC, Srinagar on Wednesday.
Asked about the recent increase in militant activities in the valley, the Governor said as his administration has disrupted the militant infrastructure in the state, the militants are doing "one-odd attacks to keep themselves relevant.
"No one has been able to stop one or two attacks, not even America, England or France. But we are working on it and will be able to find a solution to the problem. We will deal with them (militants) sternly and with precision," he said.
He said that militant recruitment and stone pelting incidents across the Kashmir Valley have also come down.
"No stone pelting takes place anywhere now not even after Friday prayers. A number of youth have also joined their families back and are leaving the militant ranks. Yesterday only two more boys returned to their families," Malik said.
Last week on Saturday, the Governor had made a similar briefing about the state while addressing the 5th Governing Council meeting of Niti Aayog.
He'd told the meeting that the militant activities have come down in J&K as the people of the state are "not giving shelter to militants."
Malik had also said time had come to focus on development of the state while giving a PowerPoint presentation and figures about militant activities.
The Governor had claimed that the administration was getting information about militants and their "activities by locals and that they are not offering shelter to those involved in militant activities."

Srinagar, June 20 -- It has been the bloodiest week for the security forces post Pulwama fidayeen attack as more than 10 soldiers including four officers were killed and several others injured in different militancy related incidents across the restive South Kashmir region since June 12.
The rise in the forces casualties comes amid reports of Pakistan sharing intelligence inputs with New Delhi and Washington about the possible militant attacks in the South Kashmir region.
The spurt in militant attacks started on June 12 when militants carried out a major fidayeen attack in Anantnag town in which five Central Reserve Police Forces (CRPF) personnel including two assistant sub inspectors and Station House Officer (SHO) of J&K police Arshad Khan were killed while three jawans and a girl were injured. A foreign militant was killed in the retaliatory action.
Later security forces went against the militants with all guns blazing and launched two separate operations in Badura and Marhama villages of Anantnag district.
Though the forces managed to kill three militants including Hafiz Sajad Bhat, whose Ecco Van was used for February 14 Pulwama bombing, the forces suffered two fatalities including Major Ketan Sharma of 19 Rashtriya Riffles and Rifleman Anil Kumar Jaiswal. Three soldiers including an officer suffered injuries in one of the operations.
The deadliest attack however was carried out in Hargam Arihal village of Pulwama district on Monday evening. Militants detonated a powerful Improvised Explosive Device (IED) when an Ashok Leyland Stallion (ALS) of the army passed through the Hargam-Arihal village. Around nine soldiers and two civilians were injured in the explosion. Two of the injured -Naik Ajit Kumar and Havaldar Amarjeet Kumar - later succumbed to their wounds.
However the army played down the injury figure saying there were "few minor bruises and concussion/contusion", without given the exact number.
"Two soldiers brought to the hospital with severe contusions/concussions have succumbed to their injuries while undergoing treatment in 92 base hospital. We deeply mourn the demise of our brave hearts", said Colonel Rajesh Kalia, defence spokesman at Srinagar.
Figures compiled by different security agencies reveal that twenty nine militants and 44 security forces men were killed in Kashmir from January 1 to February 14. Post February 14 Pulwama attack, 81 militants and 22 security force men were killed till June 13 in the Kashmir valley.
The biggest single day fatalities for the forces was on February 18 when five soldiers including a Major were killed while five others including Brigadier, Deputy Inspector General of Police and Lieutenant Colonel were injured in the gun battle at Pinglena village of South Kashmir 's Pulwama district. Three top Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) commanders including the alleged Pakistani mastermind of Pulwama fidayeen attack -Kamran-were killed in the encounter.
Six days later on February 24, Deputy Superintendent of Police (DySP) Operations Aman Kumar Thakur and an army soldier were killed in an anti-militancy operation in Kulgam. Three Jaish-e-Mohammad militants including two Pakistanis were killed in the encounter.

Two days after attack on convoy, 5 held with IED

Srinagar, June 20 -- Jammu and Kashmir police on Wednesday claimed to have foiled an attack on security forces by arresting five "associates" of the home-grown militant group Hizbul Mujahideen (HM).
Manoj Kumar, a spokesperson for the police, said an IED that was to be used for the attack was recovered on the basis of the information the five - Aqib Nazir Rather, Amir Majeed Wani, Sameer Ahmed Bhat, Faisal Farooq Ahanger and Rayees Ahmed Ganai - gave to their interrogators. He said the five were arrested from South Kashmir's Shopian district on the basis of "specific inputs".
"During questioning, it was revealed that terrorists of proscribed outfit HM along with the [five] associates were planning to target police and security forces by planting an IED," he said.
"On their disclosure, a sophisticated IED was recovered from their possession and a major terror attempt, which they had planned, was foiled."
Around a dozen soldiers were on Monday injured in an IED attack on an army patrol in Pulwama's Arihal. Two of the soldiers succumbed to their injuries on Tuesday. The army had called the attack "a failed" one and said the IED was "vehicle-based". It did not clarify if a vehicle had rammed into the army patrol like in the case of the February 14 attack that killed 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) troopers in Pulwama or if the IED was placed in a stationary vehicle.
The five were arrested a day after security forces killed an alleged Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) operative, whose van was used in the February 14 bombing. JeM claimed responsibility for the attack, which prompted India to bomb a camp of the terror group in Pakistan's Balakot on February 26.
There has been a spurt in militant attacks in Kashmir in which nine security personnel have been killed since last week. Five CRPF personnel were killed in an attack on security forces in Anantnag on June 12. Jammu and Kashmir police officer Arshad Khan, who was injured in the attack, died a day later. The Anantnag attack was the worst since the February 14 strike.
Major Ketan Sharma of the army's Rashtriya Rifles was killed in a firefight with militants in Anantnag on Monday. A militant was also killed in the fight. Three civilians were injured in a grenade attack on a police station in Pulwama.
Separately, the authorities were forced to suspend internet services in South Kashmir's Bijbehara on Wednesday after a cordon-and-search operation in the area triggered protests.
A police officer said the operation was launched after security forces received some inputs about the presence of militants there. He added the operation was called off after security forces failed to find any militants in the area.
MILITANTS HAVE LOST THE BATTLE: GOVERNOR
J&K governor Satya Pal Malik said on Wednesday that militants were carrying out odd attacks on the security forces at the behest of their handlers across the border as they have lost the battle.
"These attacks are nothing new in this place, but we have subdued it over the past six months. I believe 100% that they (militants) are under pressure from across (the border)," news agency PTI quoted Malik as saying in an apparent reference to the Pakistan-based militant handlers. "They (militant handlers) feel that they have lost as the terror infrastructure they had raised in last 10 years has been dismantled," he added.

Car bomb used to target Army patrol vehicle: NIA
Vijaita Singh,

The Hindu
THINDU

New Delhi,NATIONAL It was the third such attack in the past four months A Maruti 800 car is suspected to have been used in Monday’s terror attack on an Army patrol vehicle on the Arihal-Pulwama road in South Kashmir, initial probe suggests.
An improvised explosive device (IED) packed in a car parked by the road was detonated when a mobile vehicle patrol of the 44 Rashtriya Rifles passed by. Two Army personnel were killed and six others injured in the attack. The Army said it was “a failed attempt”.
A team of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) visited the scene of the explosion on Tuesday and picked up samples for forensic examination.
A senior government official said they were not certain about the explosives used in the attack, the third of its kind in the past four months.
Probe stuck
The NIA is also investigating the February 14 Pulwama terror attack, in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed after a car bomber — Adil Ahmed Dar, a Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) terrorist — rammed into a bus on the Jammu-Srinagar highway near Pulwama.
The second such case being investigated by the NIA was reported on March 30, when “some terrorists exploded a car laden with explosives near Banihal (in Ramban district) with intention to kill the CRPF jawans.” Six alleged Hizbul Mujahideen terrorists, including a Ph.D. scholar, were arrested for the “failed attack”.
The NIA’s investigation into the February 14 incident is stuck, as the agency is yet to trace the source of explosives used. A senior government official told The Hindu that the NIA had not received the forensic report that would establish where the explosives came from.
Lone link
The lone link, Sajad Bhat, who would have provided details about the Pulwama conspiracy, was killed in an encounter with security forces on Tuesday.
The Maruti Eeco car used in the February incident had changed hands seven times and the last person to own it was Bhat, a resident of Bijbehara in Anantnag.
The NIA said Bhat acquired the vehicle on February 4, 10 days before the attack. A student of Siraj-ul-Uloom in Shopian, Bhat later joined the JeM.
As per the initial post-blast analysis conducted by the National Security Guard (NSG), hours after the February attack, the suicide bomber’s vehicle was packed with RDX, a high grade military explosive mostly found in Army stores.
Forces warned
Security forces deployed in the Kashmir Valley have been alerted to car-borne IEDs and extra measures were being taken to sanitise routes for the Amarnath Yatra that commences on July 1. More than two lakh pilgrims are expected to visit the shrine.
Around 30,000 security forces have been deployed for the Yatra’s security.

Srinagar,NATIONAL Militancy tackled, says J&K Governor Days after Pakistan reportedly shared intelligence on an impending militant attack in Jammu & Kashmir, Governor Satya Pal Malik said in Srinagar on Wednesday that it was “duty-bound” to do so.
“Pakistan is duty-bound to share intelligence inputs with us. But how many attacks Pakistan was able to stop in its own backyard also remains to be seen,” Mr. Malik said.
His statement assumes significance after intelligence was passed on to J&K security agencies by Pakistan’s security agencies on a “likely attack by militants of the Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind to avenge the killing of the group’s chief Zakir Musa in Tral recently”.
The Governor said his administration had been able to disrupt the militant infrastructure in the State since June last year. However, militants were “still receiving directions from outside because the militancy is facing a defeat”.
“You are witness to how the previous governments tackled militancy. You are aware of our administration’s role in tackling militancy problems in the Valley. Both militant recruitment and stone-throwing incidents across the Kashmir Valley have come down,” he said. “People have understood that this way will lead us nowhere.”
‘No threat to tourists’
Mr. Malik said there was no threat to tourists in Kashmir. “Stray incidents [of violence] are still taking place. Even America, France, England and other countries failed to stop it [violence against tourists in those countries],” he said.
He said his administration would ensure the smooth conduct of the Amarnath Yatra, which begins on July 1.

Family in shock, can't believe Bhat joined militant ranks
Ashiq Hussain

Marhama (Bijbehara), June 20 -- On February 22, just a week after a car bomb had killed 40 CRPF men in Pulwama, Sajad Ahmad Bhat, a teenager, left his home at Marhama village in Bijbehara, some 45km from summer capital Srinagar.
A day later, police shocked his family members by informing them that he had joined militant outfit, Jaish-e-Mohammad.
Five more days later, the family was in for another startling revelation when the National Investigation Agency raided their two-storey modest house with the news that Bhat owned the explosive-laden Maruti Eeco, which was used in the Pulwama attack that had brought India and Pakistan to the brink of war.
On Tuesday, more than four months after the ghastly attack, Bhat was brought home dead from an encounter, along with another young local militant, Tawseef Ahmad.
"Despite being a teenager, he was very much respected here. He had learnt Quran at a tender age and also taught kids in the village. Is 17 any age to die?" said a middle-aged neighbour who was among the mourners.
As the body of Bhat was laid in the courtyard of his house, men, women and children made a beeline for catching a glimpse of the boy.
One group of people was followed by another. Some elderly said they travelled 5km on foot to see him one last time.
The funeral prayers of Bhat were delayed as people were waiting for the arrival of his father Mohammad Maqbool Bhat, an employee in public health engineering department, who has been in police custody since Sajad Bhat's name surfaced as the owner of the car.
His uncle, Tariq Ahmad Bhat, said they had no inkling that Sajad would join militancy.
"He would study, offer namaz during the day and teach village kids in the evening. That was his life. Even after Pulwama blast, he lived a normal life till February 22, when he went missing," Tariq said.
"We had no idea that he will join militancy," he added.
Sajad had learnt Quran at a Darul Uloom in Shopian and also did his basic schooling there, his uncle said, while adding that he loved cricket and captained the Darul Uloom's volleyball team.
Tariq recalled two incidents which might have changed Sajad's life. Elder of the two siblings, Sajad was very perturbed when his father was arrested in 2016. "During the 2016 agitation, his father was arrested by police and kept in jail for months on false charges of provoking protests," Tariq said.
"Then, local armymen from a camp took him away some three months before he joined militancy. Sajad was riding a bike when he was waylaid by army during a protest and tortured in custody," he claimed.
"A police officer said Sajad name cropped up in the probe related to Pulwama attack with an intel that he had purchased the vehicle a few weeks before the blast," he said.
Tariq, however, maintained that they were shocked by the police claims.
"He only owned a bike. We neither gave him a Maruti Eeco, nor was any such car in our house," he added. The villagers of Marhama are mostly farmers, while a number of youth are also working with security forces. "Many youth are working in the police department," said a resident Ubaid Ahmad.
Lance Naik Ghulam Mohiuddin Rather, who was killed in an ambush by militants in February 2017, belonged to the same village.

Soldiers' deaths in J&K terror attacks; Cong hits out at Centre for 'intelligence failure'

NEW DELHI, June 19 -- The Congress hit out at the Centre over the deaths of soldiers in recent terror attacks in Jammu and Kashmir, saying the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government will have to answer for the "intelligence failure."
Four soldiers have been killed in the last 24 hours in Jammu and Kashmir -- Major Ketan Sharma, Rifleman Anil Kumar Jaswal, Havildar Amarjeet Kumar and Naik Ajit Kumar -- Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said. In all, 10 soldiers were killed over the last week, he added. "I salute their sacrifice for the motherland," Surjewala said in a tweet in Hindi.
Two soldiers were killed and several injured in a terror attack on an army vehicle in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama, he said. "This is completely a big intelligence failure of the government."
He pointed out that five soldiers were killed in an attack on CRPF personnel in Anantnag last week, and asked whether any lesson was learnt. Seven civilians were seriously injured in a terror attack on a police station in Pulwama, Surjewala said. "We have full faith in the valour of our security forces. Today itself they have killed two terrorists," he added.
"But, the central government will have to answer for the intelligence failure. It will have to answer why are attacks taking place continuously?" the Congress leader said. On Monday, an army Major and a terrorist were killed, while another officer and two troopers were injured in an encounter in Anantnag district. On the same day in Pulwama, nine army personnel and two civilians were injured when terrorists triggered a blast through an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) fitted to a vehicle.

Jammu and Kashmir needs a policy review

Copyright 2019. HT Media Limited. All rights reserved.
India, June 19 -- Over the past week, there has been a spike in violence in Jammu and Kashmir. To their credit, security forces were able to kill the Jaish-e-Mohammed operative whose van was used in the Pulwama attack in February. At the same time, the security situation is fragile. An Army major, two soldiers, five Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel, and a Jammu and Kashmir police official have died in separate incidents. Terrorists have also caused grievous injuries to civilians in a bomb attack. While the government has claimed that these attacks represent the desperation of terror groups, since they have been at the receiving end of a successful security offensive, the violence - and the larger political situation - in the state calls for a policy review.
The central government needs to focus on a twin-track approach for Jammu and Kashmir. There is no doubt that terror groups operating from Pakistani soil, with the support of the Pakistani establishment, are continuing to cause trouble in the Valley. For the past five years, another worrying trend has been the spurt in local radicalisation. Younger Kashmiris, swayed by radical Islamist ideology, have taken to violence in ever increasing numbers. All of this means that the government will have to maintain a strong security vigil. There has to be sharper intelligence collection, more collaboration between all the security forces operating in the Valley, and a targeted crackdown on those who believe in and use the path of violence. It would be better if the Army can keep the focus on the borders and stopping cross-border terror incursions, while paramilitary forces and the state police tackle the internal turmoil, particularly in South Kashmir.
At the same time, the government needs to seriously address the political vacuum in the state. Having a locally elected government in J&K may not have always led to peace; during the tenure of the Peoples Democratic Party-Bharatiya Janata Party government, peace continued to be elusive. But not having a locally elected, legitimate government in the state is almost a guarantee for continued instability and unrest. J&K needs more democracy, not less. And the first step has to be the holding of elections as soon as possible. This will create a buffer; a rooted government will be able to tackle some local grievances. It can also, with the support of the central government, engage with diverse local stakeholders. The Bharatiya Janata Party would also be well advised to keep its key ideological issues vis-a-vis Kashmir - be it Article 35A or Article 370 - on the backburner for now, since any move to revoke these will only add to local alienation. With its strong mandate, the Narendra Modi government should focus on ensuring both peace and democracy in India's most troubled state.

'Legal Opinion Will Be Sought In One Acquittal'
Fourteen years after a terror attack on the makeshift Ram Lalla temple at the disputed site in Ayodhya allegedly by Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorists, a special court here on Tuesday convicted four of the five accused and sentenced them to life imprisonment. The fifth accused in the attack, which had taken place on July 2, 2005, was acquitted for want of evidence.
The court also imposed a fine of Rs 60,000 each on the convicted persons - Irfan, Mohammad Shakeel, Mohammad Naseem and Asif Iqbal alias Farookh. The fifth accused, Mohammad Aziz, was acquitted. All the convicts are currently lodged in the Naini Central Jail here and have been sentenced for their involvement in criminal conspiracy for murder and attempted murder. Special judge Dinesh Chand heard the case in the Naini jail itself.
UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath welcomed the verdict but said that legal opinion would be sought regarding the one acquittal. On July 2, 2005, a joint team of CRPF and UP Police personnel had killed five Lashkar terrorists, who had come to carry out a major attack on the disputed Ayodhya site, in a two-hour long gunfight. Two civilians were killed and seven CRPF jawans were injured in the encounter. Police recovered one RPG-7 rocketpropelled grenade launcher, five AK-56 assault rifles, five M1911 pistols and several M67 grenades. All five attackers, who were neutralized, were said to be from Pakistan.
Police tracked the phone calls made from the mobiles carried by the slain terrorists by using their IMEI numbers and zeroed in on the network that assisted them in the attack. Later, police arrested the five for their alleged involvement in the terror attack case. Four of them were from Poonch in Jammu and Kashmirwhile Irfan was from UP's Saharanpur district. It was alleged that they had conspired the attack and allegedly supplied arms to the terrorists.
After the arrests, the five were lodged in Faizabad jail but later shifted to the Naini Central Jail on the direction of the high court. District government counsel (criminal) Gulab Chandra Agrahri, who represented the prosecution in the matter, told TOI that a total of 63 witnesses were examined by the court through video-conferencing from the Naini jail.

The Jaish-e-Mohammad overground worker who provided the vehicle for the February 14 Pulwama suicide bombing, was killed along with another terrorist in a gunfight with security forces on Tuesday in south Kashmir's Anantnag district. An Army jawan was wounded in the encounter. Also, two soldiers who were injured in the IED blast on Monday in Pulwama district, succumbed to their injuries on Tuesday.
The two terrorists killed in an encounter in Anantnag's Bijbehara town on Tuesday were identified as Sajad Maqbool Bhat, one of the members of the Pulwama suicide squad, and his recruiter Tauseef Bhat, categorised as a 'serious threat' in police records. Sajad, a resident of Bhagpora Marhama Bijbehara in Anantnag, on February 4 had bought the Maruti Eeco van that was used for the deadly ambush that killed 44 CRPF personnel. Documents accessed exclusively by TOI reveal Sajad fled his home eight days after the attack, just when the sleuths had discovered his role as the 'logistics man' in the bombing.
As an overground worker, Sajad had been conducting reconnaissance of the area and providing information to Jaish. The van which suicide attacker Aadil Ahmad Dar rammed into the CRPF bus at Lethpora, had been sold to Mohammed Jaleel Ahmed Haqani, a resident of Heaven Colony in Anantnag in 2011, and subsequently changed hands seven times before it reached Sajad.
Sajad studied at madrassa Taleem ul Islam Marhama for three years after his seventh standard. He was enrolled at Government Higher Secondary School Marhama for 11th standard, when he fled home to join as an armed terrorist with Jaish-e-Mohammad.
The other terrorist, 23-year-old Tauseef Bhat, killed in the gunfight at Bijbehara on Tuesday, was a BA third-year student of distance learning and had joined the Jaish during Ramzan on June 12, last year. Like Sajad, Tauseef was also from Bijbehara, Anantnag district. A resident of Kodi Angan Marhama area, Tauseef used to run a 'darasgah', a religious organisation, in evening hours.

NATIONAL Sources said Bhat was also a member of the suicide squad of the JeM’s Afzal Guru group. “Bhat joined the militant ranks immediately after the Pulwama attack. Tawseef played a key role in recruiting Bhat into the JeM and was his handler,” said the police.
The two, the police said, were “involved in planning and executing a series of attacks in the area.” “Incriminating material, including arms and ammunition, has been recovered from the site of encounter. A fresh probe will establish their complicity in other crimes,” said the police.
One Army jawan, Rifleman Anil Kumar Jaswal, 35, sustained gunshot wounds in the firing and later “succumbed to his injuries.”
Meanwhile, the police said six civilians were injured, two of them seriously, in a grenade attack by militants on Pulwama’s main police station on Tuesday evening. Two soldiers, Havildar Amarjeet Kumar and Naik Ajit Kumar Sahoo, who were injured in the Improvised Explosive Device (IED) blast at Pulwama’s Arihal village on Monday evening, succumbed to their injuries on Tuesday, according to the Army spokesman.
Kumar, 35, was a resident of Bihar’s Siwan district and Sahoo, 27, hailed from Odisha’s Dhenknal district.
The body of a civilian, Nasir Ahmed, was found lying neat the encounter site at Bidoora village in Anantnag’s Achabal, where the operation was called off on Monday afternoon. The body with bullet wounds was spotted by the locals. The victim is a tractor driver.
Meanwhile, the Army paid tributes to the four deceased soldiers, including a Major, who died in three separate militancy-related incidents in the past 24 hours in south Kashmir.

Dharamshala, June 19 -- A 26-year-old rifleman from Una, Anil Kumar Jaswal, who had sustained injuries on Monday during a gunfight that also left a militant dead in south Kashmir's Anantnag, succumbed on Tuesday.
Jaswal belonged to Saroh village of Bangana subdivision in Una district of Himachal Pradesh. The Anantnag encounter had started after security forces cordoned Badoora village of Achabal town following inputs about presence of militants in the area. As the cordon was being laid around a house, a militant opened fire, killing a Major, Rahul Verma, and injuring Jaswal and another officer.
The injured were rushed to the 92 base hospital in Srinagar, where Jaswal succumbed to his injuries. The slain soldier had celebrated his birthday just two days before the encounter.
He had joined the army in 2013 and was recruited in the 13 JAK Rifles. He was currently deployed with the 44 Rashtriya Rifles. Jaswal is survived by wife Shweta, a five-month old son and parents. His father, Ashok Kumar, had also served in the army.
"We are proud of my son, who sacrificed his life for the sake of the nation. Anil was here on a leave and had joined the duty on June 7 only," said the grieving father. Bangana SDM Sanjeev Sharma said Jaswal's mortal remains will reach his native village on Wednesday and he would be cremated with full state and military honours.
Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur has also expressed grief over the death of Jaswal.

India, June 18 -- An Army soldier was killed in a gunfight with militants in Jammu and Kashmir's Anantnag on Tuesday. Two Jaish-e -Mohammed operatives were also gunned down in the encounter. One of them has been identified as Sajjad Bhat, the owner of the vehicle used in the Pulwama terror attack of February 14 in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed.
Tawseef Ahmed Bhat, who is also linked to the Pulwama attack, was the other militant gunned down on Tuesday.
Sajjad Bhat of Bijbehara was the owner of the Maruti Eeco, laden with 25kg of explosives, used in the Pulwama terror attack. Investigators of the National Investigation Agency had said Bhat, a student of a madrasa in Shopian, had been missing a few days before the attack.
The exchange of fire in Marahom village of Anantnag district on Tuesday took place after the joint force had started a cordon and search operation following intelligence inputs about the presence of militants in the area earlier in the day. The militants fired at the security personnel killing a soldier and injuring two others. The injured have been shifted to a hospital.
The army said that weapons and warlike stores have been found from the encounter site.
The army and other forces have stepped up security across the valley, especially in the militant hotbed of south Kashmir, after the CPRF troopers were killed in the Pulwama strike, which brought India and Pakistan to the brink of war.
The moves involved changes to protocols for how troops are moved in these areas, with mass movements and repeated use of the same stretch or at predictable timings being identified as vulnerabilities.
On Monday, Major Ketan Sharma from the 44 Rashtriya Rifles was killed and Major Rahul Verma was injured during a gunfight that also left a militant dead in south Kashmir's Anantnag.
The incident came less than a week after another terror attack in the town that claimed the lives of five Central Reserve Police Force troopers and one police officer.
In a separate incident, around a dozen soldiers were injured when an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) ripped through an army patrol in Pulwama district on Monday evening. Two soldiers who were injured in the blast in Arihal succumbed to injuries on Tuesday, the army said.
No group has claimed responsibility for the incidents, which come at a time of heightened security over the Amarnath Yatra that is due to begin on July 1.
Security forces have killed 113 militants this year so far, including some top commanders of militant outfits in different parts of Kashmir. After the February attack, more than 85 militants have been killed and 26 security personnel have lost their lives.

Srinagar, June 18 -- Officers of the Jammu and Kashmir Police could not hold their tears back at the wreath-laying ceremony of slain SHO Arshad Khan on Monday.
Khan, station house officer of Anantnag, had on Sunday succumbed to injuries sustained during a militant attack on June 12 in south Kashmir which claimed lives of five CRPF men.
Senior civil and police officials, including advisers to the governor, home secretary, J&K DGP, and other senior functionaries laid floral wreaths on the mortal remains and paid tributes to the officer at Police Lines, Srinagar.
Khan's five-year-old son was being held by Srinagar senior superintendent of police Haseeb Mughal in his arms during the ceremony. As the SSP marched towards the coffin for the final salute and as he laid flowers on the coffin, saluted and turned right while carrying the child, he couldn't control his emotions and his eyes welled up.
Adviser K Vijay Kumar was all praise about how Khan rushed to the rescue of fellow CRPF colleagues during the encounter.
"Within 3-4 minutes, he rushed to his fellow men' rescue. This is part of J&K synergy and we have deep admiration for it," he added.
Khan is survived by his parents, wife Neelofar, five-year-old son Abuhan Khan and two year-old-son Danim Khan. He was also supporting one unmarried brother.
Bike-borne militants had gunned down five CRPF men in an audacious daylight attack on one of the busiest roads in south Kashmir's Anantnag town on June 12. Additional forces led by Khan and a quick reaction team (QRT) rushed to the spot, only to face a volley of bullets from the militants, who also hurled grenades at the forces.
"He bravely fought against the terrorists which resulted in the killing of one terrorist," said a police spokesperson.
Al-Umar Mujahideen, a militant outfit led by Mushtaq Zager, who is currently based in Pakistan, had claimed responsibility for the attack.
Arshad Khan, a resident of Srinagar, was induced into police services in 2002 as a subinspector and was till recently posted as SHO Anantnag.
"In his late thirties, he was known for his simplicity, plain speaking and thorough professionalism. He had earned reputation for his determination and valour," the spokesperson said.

Srinagar,Today's Paper Army personnel travelling in mine-proof vehicle targeted Eight Army personnel and two civilians were injured when militants triggered an improvised explosive device (IED) fitted in a vehicle near an Army patrol in the militancy-hit Pulwama district of south Kashmir on Monday, officials said.
They said the multi-vehicle patrol of the 44 Rashtriya Rifles was moving on the Arihal-Pulwama road when the IED was detonated, injuring the personnel travelling in a bullet-and-mine-proof Casper vehicle.
The site of the IED blast is 27 km from the area where a convoy of vehicles carrying security personnel on the Jammu-Srinagar National Highway was attacked by a suicide bomber on February 14 in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed.
Major killed
In another incident, an Army officer and a militant were killed during an encounter in Anantnag.
A Srinagar-based police spokesman said Major Ketan Sharma, 32, from Meerut, Uttar Pradesh, was injured when a search party of the security forces encircled hiding militants and came under “heavy fire” at Badoora village in Anantnag’s Achabal area in the morning.
“Sharma was evacuated to a hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries,” said the police.
(With PTI inputs)
Two other Army officials, including Major Rahul Verma, suffered injuries in the day-long exchange of fire between the militants and the security forces in Anantnag. “One militant was killed in the ongoing operation. His body was retrieved and his identity and affiliation are being ascertained,” said the police.
Referring to the IED blast, Army spokesman Colonel Rajesh Kalia said it was “a failed attempt” to attack the mobile vehicle patrol of the 44 Rashtriya Rifles. “Alertness of the patrol party helped to minimise the damage,” said the spokesman.
The police spokesman confirmed that six soldiers were injured in the IED blast, which inflicted severe damage on the Army vehicle.
The attack on the Army vehicle comes days after Pakistan intelligence agencies reportedly shared information on the Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind’s plans to carry out a major attack using a vehicle to “avenge” its chief Zakir Musa in Pulwama on May 24.

ANATNAG, June 17 -- An army officer and a militant were killed while three other army men including a major suffered wounds during a gunfight in southern Anantnag district on Monday.
The encounter raged in Badooda village of Achabal in the wee hours after a joint contingent of counter insurgent forces threw a ring of cordon around the area following credible inputs about the presence of militants there.
Officials said a couple of hours after the cordon was launched around the village, forces came in contact with the hiding militants. The two sides exchanged fire for a brief period.
"After the brief exchange of fire there was a lull in the firing for several hours. In the early afternoon as the forces intensified the searches the firing resumed between the two sides," officials said.
They said in the gunfight that continued almost throughout the day, a militant, believed to be a foreigner and an army major were killed. Three other army personnel, including a Major, reports said, were also wounded in the gunfight.
The identity of the killed militant had not been ascertained when this report was being filed.
However, reports identified the army officer killed in the gunfight as Ketan Sharma and the wounded army Major as Rahul Sharma. The injured army men, officials said, were evacuated to army hospital Srinagar for treatment.
Reports said that the army suffered casualties in the last phase of gunfight.
Army presumed that the militant has been killed and advanced to retrieve the body. As they started searching for the dead body the hiding militant again attacked them killing an officer and wounding three others," reports said.
In the gunfight, reports said, a residential house and a cowshed were damaged.
Authorities also snapped internet services in Anantnag district soon after the gunfight raged.
Though district headquarter Anantnag and other townships witnessed normal business, however, Achabal township, observed a complete shutdown.

At wedding of soldier's sister, 50 IAF commandos give an emotional farewell

India, June 17 -- Shashikala had lost her brother several months ago, but when she got married a few days ago, she had 50 brothers giving her a unique bidayee from her parents' home.
The colleagues of martyred Air Force Garud unit commando Jyoti Prakash Nirala, who was killed fighting extremists at Bandipora, Jammu & Kashmir, on November 18, 2017, attended the wedding of his sister and, in a unique gesture, they kneeled on the floor in two rows, hands on the floor, palms facing up, creating a path so that their 'sister' could walk to the bridegroom and exchange garlands.
Nirala had gunned down two extremists, Ubaid alias Osama, the nephew of Lashkar commander Lakhvi, and Mahmood Bhai. He died saving the lives of injured fellow commandos. For his sacrifice, he was given the Ashok Chakra, the highest peacetime military decoration for courageous action, on Republic Day, 2018. His mother Malti Devi and wife Sushma received the award from President Ram Nath Kovind.
The martyred commando was the only son among four children of marginal farmer Tej Narayan Singh of village Badiladih, in Karakat block of Rohtas district. Later, Singh fixed the marriage of his third daughter Shashikala and sent an invitation to the Air Chief Marshall and the Garud commando unit. It was a gesture on the father's part.
What a surprise he got when about 50 commandos of the Garud unit reached Singh's house two days before the wedding and took charge of all the arrangements. They contributed Rs 5 lakh for the wedding expenses, and participated as brothers in Lava Merava, Chhatra Dharayee, and other marriage rituals. The commandos belonged to different parts of the country, and the bride said that she felt her brothers had come from all across India.
The overwhelmed parents said, "We lost one son, but got 50 sons today. These sons filled us with love and respect and assured us that we are not alone and helpless. Today, the entire nation is with us. God bless you, my children."
Bridegroom Sujit Kumar of Dehri, a loco pilot in Bengaluru, and his father Uma Shankar Yadav, also a railway employee, said that they felt honoured by this match with a martyr's family.

Rising IS role in Kashmir, finds NIA probe against 4 caught by chance

India, June 17 -- The Islamic State's (IS) presence in Jammu and Kashmir has been registered in a charge sheet by the National Investigation Agency (NIA)filed in a Jammu court recently, noting a "gradual increase" in the outfit's activity in the region.
The Islamic State, Khorasan (ISK) has expanded to form a Kashmir-specific unit called Islamic State - Jammu and Kashmir (ISJK), the NIA has said in its charge sheet and added that the formation of the new entity was featured in Dabiq, a magazine run by IS, in 2016.
Four people from Kashmir, including a student, a Srinagar-based businessperson and "copper artists", formed the core of an ISJK module, according to NIA. They were, however, caught by chance, according to a sequence of events pieced together by NIA in the charge sheet. Stopped at a police check post at the Tourist Reception Centre in Srinagar in November 2018, they tried to escape by lobbing a grenade but were caught, NIA told the court.
Those named in the charge sheet by NIA were Tahir Ahmad Khan, 24, Haris Mushtaq Khan, 25, Asif Suhail Nadaf, 22, and Asif Majid Khan, 34. Interestingly, of the four accused, three had no previous criminal record. Only Asif Majid, the oldest of the four, had come to the notice of the police for stone throwing. Mushtaq, a student of English literature, was also pursuing political science and international studies when he disappeared. His father Mushtaq Ahmad Khan had even approached the police to trace his son, the NIA?probe revealed.
"The presence of the Islamic State in J&K increased gradually" and "the Islamic State news agency Amaq claimed responsibility for an attack in Srinagar in November 2017", NIA said in its charge sheet. It added that said the presence of IS in Jammu and Kashmir came to notice in 2016.
Security experts cautioned against taking the group's presence lightly even if the danger it poses is second to Pakistan-backed militant groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), which was behind the February 14 attack on a paramilitary?convoy in Pulwama, and also last week's ambush in which six CRPF troopers were killed in Anantnag.
"The concept of azadi [freedom] has mutated over the years. The Islamic State is already entrenched in Afghanistan. The recent Easter bombings show that they have spread to Sri Lanka too. I would be surprised if the ideology doesn't have its impact in J&K," said K Rajendra, former DGP of J&K.
A November 2017 attack in Srinagar in which a policeman was killed appeared to be the first IS-inspired attack in the Valley, NIA said. "The militant killed in the attack Mugees Ahmad Mir was inspired by IS propaganda," the charge sheet said.
"There is an emotional connection with an ideology like that of the Islamic State, unlike that of the Al Qaeda...No one can predict who will get swayed by the IS ideology," said Avinash Mohanani, a former Intelligence Bureau hand who spent many years in Jammu and Kashmir and in counterterror operations.
"The Easter bombings in Sri Lanka are proof of that... Traditional means of collecting intelligence will not work because one is not sure where to look and what to look for. The presence of IS in J&K will be a serious challenge."
But unlike earlier IS modules unearthed in India where individuals were found to have been self-radicalised, this group was inducted by IS operatives from Jammu and Kashmir, NIA said.
For instance, Tahir was initiated into IS as an active member by Asif Nazir, a resident of Panzgam, Pulwama, NIA said. Ishfaq Ahmad and Parvez Ahmad - both IS militants killed in an encounter - taught the group of four how to handle weapons and explosives, NIA said. The charge sheet is silent on certain issues; for instance, where the module trained to handle explosives.
Besides Asif Nazir of Panzgam who indoctrinated the four accused to join the Islamic State, Huzafa - a shadowy figure from Afghanistan - appears to have played a critical role in nurturing the IS module, according to NIA.

GETTING A GRIP OF KASHMIR'S PROBLEM
Kalyani Shankar

16 June 2019
Kashmir Times
HTKAST

Srinagar, June 16 -- While neighbouring Pakistan needs to be taught a lesson for sponsoring terrorist attacks in Kashmir, the need is to also address the Kashmir problem internally. There can be no doubt that there are many things that need attention, including the radicalisation of the youth in the State. It was indeed disheartening to hear that it was a local young suicide bomber who caused the Pulwama attacks. It needs to be probed further as to why misguided youths are getting increasingly attracted towards militancy and terrorism. For quite some time now, there have been intense debates on whether a sizeable number of educated youths are joining militant ranks in some parts of south and north Kashmir or not. Former Union Minister Yashwant Sinha was right when he noted that radicalisation is happenning not because of one reason but due to a combination of things. This includes the role of Pakistan, Wahabism and Islamic fundamentalism.
Alienation and disempowerment among Kashmiri youth is yet another factor as also proxy war from Pakistani side for the youth to get recruited by militant organisations like the Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM). Further, Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI)-sponsored propaganda and intolerant religious and ideological narratives have played an instrumental role in eroding the ideals of Kashmiriyat and has gradually taken them towards jihadist culture. As Chief of Army Staff General Bikram Singh noted in a recent article that compared to 131 youth, who joined various terrorist outfits in 2017, the number rose to over 200 in 2018. Some new terrorist outfits, such as the Islamic State Jammu and Kashmir and Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind aligned to the Islamic State (IS) and Al Qaeda ideologies have also marked increased presence in the last few years. Experts point out that these are children from conflict zones, who have seen guns and rifles on the streets when they were growing up. These children missed their childhood and saw only violence and conflict, which robbed them off their childhood. Second, it is the lack of educational opportunities in the State that is alienating the youth. Third, the youth do not find adequate jobs. Former Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW) chief, AS Daulat, feels that the youth are getting radicalised because they feel that they have no hope. The Jamaat-e-Islami is going about systematically filling this vacuum. They also enjoyed support from the People's Democratic Party (PDP), which won the elections with support from the Jamaat. Now, there is huge disillusionment in the Jamaat over PDP. Social media was one of the major tools used by militants to propagate their ideology and to corrupt young minds of the Kashmir Valley. The only way to reverse this trend is to bring them round. There is an imperative need to look inwards and correct things as even now, it is not too late. The fact that a Kashmiri kid decided to be a suicide bomber in Pulwama is an answer from the youth of the State to the flawed policy of gun in Kashmir. The young boy was one of those who felt he had no hope left in Kashmir. His father is a farmer and the boy was shot in the leg some time back perhaps for pelting stones on the streets. So, he decided to blow himself up. This attack shows the extent of extreme alienation of the youth. The counter-narrative is the immediate requirement. The Government as well as political parties must address this on a priority. Kashmir Governor Satya Pal Malik told this writer that after six in the evening, there is no activity in the villages. To address this problem the Governor has started the screening of cinema and radio shows as also some sports activities for the young to keep them occupied. It is a welcome step that the Governor has already set up some groups for a counter-narrative and is also in talks with the maulvis to get them on board so as to tackle fundamentalism. Governor Malik feels that mainstream politicians are not taking the responsibility. Hardcore radicals are not many and he had told the forces to address the problem of home-grown radicalisation. He is worried that the youth are now using 'Jannat me jaane ka hai' language. The immediate thing is to set our own house in order. More guns are not the answer. Something else needs to be done. Kashmir experts like Daulat feel radicalisation could be reversed if proper measures are taken. As a first step, the Centre can talk to State leaders like National Conference president Farooq Abdullah, former Chief Minister of Jammu & Kashmir Omar Abdullah, PDP chief Mehboobha Mufti and even the Hurriyat. One really cannot talk to the suicide bombers. The next step should be the installation of a popular Government as a democratic Government. This will be the real answer to settle things in the State and not Governor's rule. Above all, there is an immediate need to calm down sentiments and bring back normalcy in the State. Confidence-building measures and not bashing up of Kashmiri boys and girls in Chandigarh or elsewhere should be the answer. Bashing would further alienate the youth. This would have further reaction in the State. In short, what is needed is a steady and long-term Kashmir policy.

Pak fails to fulfill 25 out of 27 FATF action points P L Uniyal NEW DELHI, Jun 16: Pakistan has failed to complete 25 of the 27 action points given by the international terror financing watchdog Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to check funding to terrorist groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammedand frontal groups like Jamat-ud-Dawah and Falah-e-Insaniat Foundation, sources said. With this, multilateral lenders like the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and the European Union may continue downgrading Pakistan, making its financial situation more precarious. Pakistan is in deep trouble at the FATF meeting beginning Sunday in Florida in the US, people aware of the development said. "It has been unable to complete 25 of its 27 action points. It has one last chance, till its 15-month deadline ends in October 2019, when the FATF plenary will be held," one of them added. The Paris-headquartered FATF has asked Pakistan to explain whether it has launched any investigation into the $7 million allocated to maintain schools, madrasas, clinics and ambulances originally operated by terror groups like LeT and JeM and their fronts. JuD and FIF are founded by terror mastermind Hafiz Saeed. LeT is responsible for a number of strikes in India, including the 2008 Mumbai attacks and the hijacking of an Indian Airlines aircraft to Afghanistan in 1999. Most recently, it attacked a CRPF bus in Pulwama in February, killing 40 soldiers. In June 2018, Pakistan was placed in the "grey" list and given a 27-point action plan by the FATF. This plan was reviewed at the last plenary in October 2018 and for the second time in February this year, when the country was again put into the "grey" list after India submitted new information about Pakistan-based terrorist groups. The FATF continuing Pakistan in the "grey" list means its downgrading by IMF, World Bank, ADB, EU and also a reduction in risk rating by Moody's, S&P and Fitch. This will add to the financial problems of Pakistan, which is seeking aid from all possible international avenues. The Pakistani authorities have shown the arrests of LeT, JeM, JuD and FIF cadre as action taken, but they were all arrested under its Maintenance of Public Order Act and not under the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997. Under the MPO Act, authorities cannot hold a detainee beyond 60 days. Pakistan has detained JeM founder Masood Azhar and LeT founder Hafiz Saeed mostly under the laws that provide for detention for apprehension of breach of peace; they have never been prosecuted under anti-terror laws. The FATF implements UN designations, which do not warrant arrest. They ask only for freeze of funds, denial of access to weapons and travel embargo. The financial watchdog also wants nations to impose penalties that are proportionate and dissuasive. The MPO Act is not seen as satisfying either of the two conditions. Therefore, none of these arrests will satisfy the FATF or the UN Designations Committee. Pakistan has also seized several hundred properties of LeT, JuD, FiF and JeM, including schools and madrasas. However, these properties are now being run by its provincial governments. The Punjab provincial government has allocated USD 2 million (Pakistani Rs 30 crore or Indian Rs 14 crore) per annum for their upkeep. Similarly, other provinces have allocated USD 5 million. The annual expense allocated by Pakistan totals USD 7 million (Pakistani Rs 105 or Indian Rs 49 crore). The FATF has now asked Pakistan to explain whether there are any terror-funding investigations to unearth the sources and entities that funded these organisations with USD 7 million per annum for the past several years. The FATF currently has 35 members and two regional organisations - European Commission and Gulf Cooperation Council. In the last meeting of the FATF in Paris, the FATF said Pakistan should continue to work on implementing its action plan to address its strategic deficiencies, including by adequately demonstrating its proper understanding of the terror financing risks posed by the terrorist groups and conducting supervision on a risk-sensitive basis, demonstrating that remedial actions and sanctions are applied in cases of Anti-Money Laundering and Combating Financing of Terrorism violations and that these actions have an effect on AML/CFT compliance by financial institutions. Pakistan, it said, should demonstrate that competent authorities are cooperating and taking action to identify and take enforcement action against illegal money or value transfer services, demonstrating that authorities are identifying cash couriers and enforcing controls on illicit movement of currency and understanding the risk of cash couriers being used for terror financing (TF), improving inter-agency coordination including between provincial and federal authorities on combating TF risks besides others.

'Pak warns India of Pulwama-like IED attack'

Srinagar, June 16 -- Pakistan has shared information regarding the threat of a possible attack in south Kashmir's Pulwama district, Indian Express reported on Sunday.
The entire security grid in J&K is on its toes after the alert, which came just days ago, regarding a possible attack by militants using an improvised explosive device mounted on a vehicle, the report said.
"The Pakistanis shared this information regarding the possibility of such an attack with our High Commission in Islamabad. They had also shared this information with the Americans, who too, informed us. So this information has come directly as well as via the Americans to us," Express quoted an official saying.
"The attack, the Pakistanis say, is being ostensibly planned to avenge the killing of Zakir Musa," the official was quoted saying by the newspaper.
Musa, who launched and headed an al-Qaeda affiliate called Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind in Kashmir after breaking away from the Hizbul Mujahideen in May 2017, was killed in an operation in the Tral area last month. Police sources said Ansar, which had an estimated membership of about a dozen militants, is now down to "two to three" militants.
The security official, as per the Express report, said: "We are reading Pakistan's sharing of this information in two ways. It is either a way to make sure that they avoid blame if a big attack takes place, because they have already shared the information with the Americans. Or it is a genuine attempt to inform us ahead after they found out, particularly because the information is regarding a plan to attack by members of an al-Qaeda linked group."
"We also understand that any activities of terrorists linked to al-Qaeda are seen differently by them (Pakistan)," the official said.
Another senior police officer confirmed the alert. "We are always on alert, especially in South Kashmir. But we are taking this alert very seriously," this officer said.
Zakir Rashid Bhat alias Zakir Musa, the police claims, was the last surviving member of the Burhan Wani group. Wani was killed on July 8, 2016. Musa subsequently broke away from the Hizbul Mujahideen in May 2017 to set up the Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind, which he claimed was a local affiliate of al-Qaeda. The Global Islamic Media Front, the online propaganda arm of al-Qaeda, had released a statement on the setting up of the Ansar in Kashmir.
Musa was a civil engineering student at a college in Chandigarh when he went missing in July 2013, and joined the Hizbul Mujahideen subsequently. In 2017, Musa released an audio threatening top separatist leaders in the Valley. He was also publicly critical of Pakistan.
The February 14 fidayeen car bomb attack in which over 40 personnel of the Central Reserve Police Force were killed, had taken place on the highway at Lethpora (also in Pulwama district), which is 7 km from Awantipora. The attack had prompted India to launch the Balakot airstrikes on February 26, and Pakistan had retaliated the following day.
Temperatures were lowered after Pakistan returned IAF Wing Commander Abhinandan who had been captured after his MiG-21 Bison was shot down.

J&K Police smashes 'governance infrastructure' of militants inside jails

SRINAGAR, June 16 -- The Jammu and Kashmir Police has busted 'Shuara-e-Zindan' (supreme council for jail), a term used by militants for governance inside prisons, and restored the prison manual completely, officials said here.
After the escape of Naveed Jhatt, a Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorist, last February, the Jammu and Kashmir prison department under the leadership of Dilbagh Singh took a series of measures to sanitise prisons, including shifting all hardcore terrorists from the Srinagar Central Jail.
"A complete analysis of the prisoners was carried out and the message was loud and clear that the hold of terrorists inside the prison needs to be broken and rule of law needs to be implemented," says Singh, who recently relinquished the post of Director General of Prisons, said.
However, he did not elaborate further on the measures carried out and said "we have only ensured that hardened terrorists and separatists are segregated from those who are first-timers and have a scope of improvement." However, the officials in the state prison department said after Singh took charge, raids and searches were carried out regularly and hardcore terrorists were shifted to other jails in Jammu and Udhampur.
Two cases were registered at Rainawari police station which includes the one where militants were operating "Shaura-e-Zindan" inside the jail which used to decide allotment of barracks and other amenities to the prisoners, the officials said. The 'Shaura-e-Zindan' used to provide facilities to the prisoners based on their experience in the field of militancy, which includes food of their choice and other facilities, they said, adding Ashiq Hussain Faktoo, serving life sentence, was the supreme commander of this group.
Now, after the crackdown and repeated searches, all private kitchens operating inside the jail premises, have been shut and all inmates queue up to the common 'langar' where they are served food, they said. The Srinagar Central Jail had earlier become a hub of radicalisation which was smashed during Singh's tenure. There was a report in December 2017 that "sermons are given on Jehad...The basic tenets of religion are overlooked and emphasis is laid on radical aspects. Such religious sermons have a deep psychological impact on inmates and youths in particular who develop inclination towards joining militancy or getting recruited as overground workers (for militants)."
It said the jail, which is expected to act as a correctional facility, is "instead being used as a place of religious indoctrination and militant recruitment". "It is being observed that even petty criminal who spend some time in jails are today coming out as highly indoctrinated individuals with religious motivation to support or even join militant ranks," it said.
However, Singh ensured that there is a segregation of prisoners and people arrested for charges under terrorism or separatism are treated with higher degree of caution and separated from inmates arrested for petty crimes.

Multi-agency body to track all terrorism cases in Jammu and Kashmir

India, June 16 -- A multi-disciplinary terror monitoring group, which is led by the Jammu and Kashmir Police and includes representatives from the Intelligence Bureau, Central Bureau of Investigation, National Investigation Agency and the income tax department, will now expand its ambit to monitor the progress of all terror-related cases in the Valley, officials aware of the developments said on Saturday.
The group was initially set up to evaluate evidence when the Centre had decided to declare Jammat-e-Islami (Jammu and Kashmir) and the Jammu KashmirLiberation Front (JKLF) as banned organisations under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.
"The group will continue to monitor major terror-related cases. The primary motive is to ensure that terror-related cases, especially those before the courts, do not fall between two stools for lack of evidence. That is why the J&K Police has been made the fulcrum," a senior official of the ministry of home affairs said on condition of anonymity.
In the first six months of this year, security forces have killed 111 militants, including some top commanders of terror outfits in different parts of Kashmir. In the deadliest terror attack in the Valley, 40 troopers of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) were killed in a suicide attack in Pulwama in February. Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed claimed responsibility for the attack.
Investigative agencies are also looking into cases of terror funding, with Kashmiri separatist leaders such as Shabir Shah, Asiya Andrabi and Masarat Alam Bhat being investigated over such charges. Arrested by the NIA, the three separatists have been sent to judicial custody till July 12.
A second official said the NIA's terror financing investigations in Jammu and Kashmir have revealed a steady flow of funds for terrorist activities. Pakistan-based Hafiz Saeed, the chief of the banned terror group Jammat-ud- Dawa, Hizbul Mujahedeen chief Syed Salahuddin and other Hurriyat leaders are key accused in the terror-financing case that the monitoring group will track, the official said.
Another official said that Masarat Alam Bhat is believed to have told the NIA that Pakistan regularly sends funds through the hawala route.
A fourth official, asking not to be named, said the funds are often used to organise unrest in J&K and "significant evidence relating to funding of these separatists elements through Pakistan and UAE-based businessmen. has been collected and presented to the NIA special court".

LINK DECODEDAt least two Islamic State Jammu & Kashmir (ISJK) terrorists arrested from Srinagar in November 2018 for an attempted strike on a police party, were in online contact with a Pakistani and active Islamic State cadre based in Afghanistan, Huzaifa, who instigated and motivated them to work for Islamic State in J&K.
NIA chargesheet in the case filed on May 22 names four accused - the motorcycle-borne attackers Tariq Ahmed Khan, Haris Mushtaq Khan and Asif Suhail Nadaf who jumped the police naka and attempted to lob a grenade - and Asif Majeed, who allegedly provided food and shelter to the co-accused and collected weapons at the instance of Haris.
As per the chargesheet accessed by TOI, the presence and influence of ISJK has been manifesting since 2014 when IS flags were first waved in Kashmir, followed by killing of IS-inspired Mugees Ahmed Mir in November 2017 whose body was wrapped in IS flag, declaration of Kashmir-based IS wing Al-Hind in 2016, killing of ISJK head Dawood and three others in Srigufwara in June 2018 and more recently, announcement by IS-linked Amaq News Agency in May of 'Wilayah of Hind' after the killing of ISJK terrorist Ishfaq Ahmad Sofi."Kashmir offers a fertile ground as it has a long history of Pakistan-sponsored terrorism against the state, gingered with local demand for azaadi," the chargesheet said adding that the social media expansion has only raised the opportunity to reach potential aspirants.
Tahir Ahmed Khan had come in contact with Asif Nazar Dar, a self-styled commander of ISJK now killed, in 2018. They shared jihadi material, IS-related content, voice and text messages.
Tahir also came in online contact with Huzaifa, a Pakistani IS cadre based in Afghanistan. Nazir convinced Tahir to join ISJK in September 2018 at his house in Srinagar, where Ishfaq Sofi was present. Nazar directed Tahir to operate in Valley and put him under ISJK terrorist Adil Wani.

NEW DELHI: The custodial interrogation of JKLF chairman Yasin Malik by NIA in April and that of JKDFP chief Shabir Shah, prime organiser of stone-pelting protests of 2016 Masarat Alam and Dukhtaran-e-Milat chief Asiya Andrabi earlier this month has allegedly corroborated how terror funds were routed by Pakistan-based sources via hawala route to Kashmiri separatists, who then used them to fuel unrest and organise violent agitations in Valley.NIA sources told TOI that Malik, interrogated by NIA sleuths here in April, revealed that he was instrumental in bringing together the disparate factions of Hurriyat Conference to form the Joint Resistance Leadership that spearheaded the violent agitations of 2016 in Kashmir Valley following the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen terrorist Burhan Wani. JRL had then issued 'protest calendars' leading to economic shutdown for over four months.
Many civilians and security forces were killed or injured in these protests.Malik has purportedly admitted that JRL and Hurriyat faction headed by Syed Ali Shah Geelani had collected funds from the business community and certain other sources and ensured that the economic shutdown and violent protests continued to disrupt the daily life of common citizens in the Valley.During interrogation earlier this month, Asiya Andrabi is said to have admitted to collecting funds and donations from foreign sources for Dukhtaran-e-Milat, which organised protests by Muslim women in the Valley. Andrabi was confronted with evidence regarding funding of educational expenses of her son in Malaysia from 2011 onwards, allegedly through foreign remittances made by Kashmiri businessman and arrested accused in the case Zahoor Watali.NIA has already approached the concerned authorities for providing evidence relating to certain bank accounts used by Andrabi's son Mohammad bin Qasim while he was studying at University in Malaysia.

NEW DELHI, June 15 -- A Delhi court on Friday sent Kashmiri separatists Shabir Shah, Asiya Andrabi and Masarat Alam Bhat, arrested by National Investigation Agency (NIA) in connection with a terror funding case, to judicial custody till July 12.
The case relates to alleged terror funding in the Valley and involves Jama'at-ud-Da'wah (JuD) chief Hafiz Saeed, the 2008 Mumbai terror attack mastermind based in Pakistan. Special Judge Rakesh Syal sent the trio to custody after the NIA did not seek any further custodial interrogation, advocate MS Khan, appearing for the accused, said. The NIA had arrested the three separatists on July 4 during in-chamber proceedings in the court and the agency was granted 10-day custody of the trio.
Shah and Andrabi were already in custody in separate cases, while Alam was earlier brought from Jammu and Kashmir on transit remand where he was lodged in jail for alleged terror activities.
The NIA had filed a chargesheet in January 2018 against Saeed, another terror mastermind Syed Salahuddin and 10 Kashmiri separatists in a case of alleged terror funding and secessionist activities in the Valley.
While Shah was in judicial custody in a decade-old money laundering case for alleged terror financing, Andrabi was in jail in a case of allegedly waging war against the country and delivering hate speeches.
According to the NIA, Shah had received Rs 10 lakh from hawala operator Zahoor Ahmad Shah Watal, a co-accused in the case.
Besides, the money was also sent to the banned outfit Dukhtaraan-e-Milat of which Andrabi was the chief, the NIA had said.
The case in which the accused were arrested on July 4 relates to alleged conspiracy to wage war against the government (Section 121 of the Indian Penal Code) by carrying out terrorist and secessionist activities in Jammu and Kashmir.
The probe agency has chargesheeted 12 persons, including Saeed, and Hizbul Mujahideen chief Syed Salahuddin. Other offences for which the accused were chargesheeted include those punishable under Sections 120-B of the IPC (criminal conspiracy) and various provisions of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967.

Syed Salahuddin in a statement issued to GNS said, "eight lakh Indian forces are carrying out atrocities against the people of Kashmir and when the mujahideen retaliate, the Indian leadership blames Pakistan."
The UJC chief said the attacks of Pulwama in February and now Anantnag were carried out by local militants.
He said the 'enormous atrocities' on Kashmiris have forced them to become Fidayeens.
Syed Salahuddin strongly reacted against the statement of S P Malik wherein he termed the Anantnag attack as threat to Amarnath yatra.
"This is an attempt to tarnish the communal fabric of Kashmir," he said and strongly condemned the Governor's "mentality".
The UJC chief said Jammu & Kashmir is an abode of different religions and that Kashmiri Muslims have always been the best hosts to yatris.
"It is India itself where there is intolerance towards minorities," he said.
Syed Salahuddin, who is also the chief of Hizb-ul-Mujahideen, said it is New Delhi's intransigence that has forced Kashmiris toward armed resistance.
If India implements the UN resolutions on Kashmir and gives the people of JK their right of choosing their destiny, the situation would be different and there would be no resistance, he said.
"The struggle at all fronts will continue till the goal is achieved," he added.

HISAR, June 14 -- A pal of gloom descended at Kheri Jatt village in Jhajjar district on Thursday after the body of martyred Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) soldier Ramesh Kumar Gulia, 50, arrived there.
Motorcycle-borne militants gunned down Gulia and four other CRPF men in Anantnag in Jammu and Kashmir on Wednesday. Guliya, an assistant sub-inspector (AS), was cremated with full state honours in the presence of state agriculture minister OP Dhankar. The funeral pyre was lit by Gulia's elder son Mohit Kumar.
Hundreds of villagers and Gulia's relatives gathered during the last rites and shouted 'Bharat Mata ki Jai' (hail Mother India) slogans. Besides Dhankar, Rohtak MP Arvind Sharam, CRPF inspector general (IG) Ramesh Dutta and Jhajjar deputy commissioner Sanjay Joon were also present.
Talking to mediapersons, Dhankar announced Rs 50 lakh financial help for the family. His brother Rajesh Gulia requested the minister for government jobs for Ramesh's two sons.
The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)'s Haryana chief Naveen Jaihind also announced Rs 1 crore for the family.
Dhankar said he will recommend to name of the village government school after the martyr. "Haryana is the land of soldiers who will reply back to terror. Earlier, Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave a free hand to the Indian army who crossed the border and destroyed terror camps by carrying out surgical strike and air-strikes," he added.
MP Arvind Sharma said the Haryana government will stand with the family.
Srinagar Jammu and Kashmir governor Satya Pal Malik said on Thursday that the 'fidayeen' (suicide squad) attack in Anantnag district on Wednesday was carried out at the behest of Pakistan.
Speaking to the media here, Malik said: "Pakistan ordered yesterday's fidayeen attack. Whenever there is peace in the Valley, Pakistan tries to disrupt it by resorting to such attacks."
The Governor said the peaceful conduct of the Lok Sabha elections had not gone down well with the handlers of militants in Pakistan.

New Delhi, June 12 -- Pakistan on Wednesday sought more information and evidence from India to take forward cooperation in the investigation into the Pulwama suicide attack that was claimed by Jaish-e-Mohammed and killed 40 troops. Islamabad made the demand for more evidence while sharing with New Delhi its preliminary findings after examining the dossier shared by India on the February 14 terror attack that triggered a major stand-off between the two sides.
India's dossier had contained extensive evidence on JeM's involvement in the bombing carried out by a 22-year-old man from Jammu and Kashmir. It also had information on JeM's Pakistan-based chief Masood Azhar and other leaders of the banned terror group.
The dossier was shared after Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan promised to act if "actionable evidence" was provided.p9

2016 surgical strike a first: northern command chief
641 words
12 June 2019
Hindustan Times
HNTM
English
Copyright 2019. HT Media Limited. All rights reserved.
New Delhi, June 12 -- Army's northern command chief, Lt Gen Ranbir Singh, on Monday said the September 2016 surgical strike on terrorist launchpads in PoK was the first such operation to be carried out. He said this while citing a recent reply of the DGMO under the RTI Act.
"A few days ago, DGMO said in a reply to an RTI query that the first surgical strike happened in September 2016. I do not want to go into what political parties say. They will be given an answer to by the government. What I have told you is a statement of fact," Lt Gen Singh told reporters in Jammu and Kashmir's Udhampur.
This is for the first time that a senior officer has spoken on the record about whether the September 2016 strike was the army's first such targeted operation.
He was referring to the DGMO's reply in which it said on May 8 that the army had no data to suggest that surgical strikes were conducted across the de-facto India-Pakistan border in Jammu and Kashmir - the Line of Control (LoC) - before September 2016.
He was responding to Congress's claims that six surgical strikes were conducted when it led the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government at the Centre until 2014.
Lt Gen Singh's statement came days after former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh told HT on May 2 that his government conducted "multiple surgical strikes" when it was in power but did not believe in using them for "vote garnering".
Singh's statement triggered a war of words between the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the middle of the Lok Sabha elections. Finance minister, Arun Jaitley, reacted to his comments saying those strikes were "invisible and unknown".
Lt Gen Singh headed the Directorate of Military Operations when the September 2016 strikes were carried out in response to an attack on an army camp in Jammu and Kashmir's Uri in which 19 soldiers were killed.
HT spoke to several serving and retired army officers following Manmohan Singh's comments about the strikes. They confirmed that there had indeed been several cross-border operations before 2014. "However, the difference is that the previous regime did not talk about the targeted operations. This government took ownership of the strikes and announced to the world that India would pursue terrorists beyond its boundaries," one of them said on condition of anonymity.
The officers said the UPA-era strikes were ordered at the tactical level and were not cleared by the top leadership of the day.
Congress leader, Abhishek Singhvi, reacted to Lt Gen Singh's statement saying this is why they have condemned Prime Minister Narendra Modi for drawing the armed forces into controversy and debate with political classes. "Frankly I would not like to reply to the army commander and would not like to draw him into a political debate. But since we are being forced to do so please take the list of eight official published details of surgical strikes which Manmohan Singh has also repeated, I would rather go by his sober comments than cheap politics."
Lt Gen Singh also lauded the February 26 air strike in Pakistan's Balakot and described it as a major achievement as Indian fighter jets went deep into enemy territory and struck a terror camp. India launched the air strike on a Jaish-e-Mohammad camp on February 26 after the group claimed responsibility for the February 14 attack on a paramilitary convoy in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama in which 40 troopers were killed.

Two 'IS-inspired militants' killed in Shopian: Police

Srinagar, June 12 -- Two "Islamic State (IS)-inspired militants" were killed in a firefight with security forces at Awneera in South Kashmir's Shopian district on Monday, the Jammu and Kashmir police said in a statement.
The statement identified the two as Sayar Ahmad Bhat and Shakir Ahmad Wagay.
The IS terror group overran swathes of Iraq and Syria in 2014 before Baghdad declared a victory over it in 2017. In March, US-backed forces in Syria said they have defeated the group in Syria as well. The IS's defeat in Syria marked an end to the group's territorial control, which was used to carry attacks across the world.
The statement said Bhat and Wagay were wanted for terror crimes, including attacks on security establishments. It added Wagay was involved in the killing of a civilian, Irfan Hameed Sheikh, in Zainapora. The statement did not elaborate on the nature of other crimes or attacks the two were wanted for. The government has so far maintained that there was no direct link between the IS and those it has allegedly inspired in Kashmir.
In February, the then Union minister of state for home affairs, Hansraj Gangaram Ahir, told Lok Sabha that seven local youths had joined an IS-inspired group in Kashmir through "self-proclamation". Ahir added four of them were killed in June 2018 at Khiram in South Kashmir's Anantnag district while two were arrested and one remained active.

Indian composers and singers release independent singles dedicated to the jawans, who lost their lives during the terror attack in Kashmir on February 14 this year
The Pulwama terror attack on February 14 shook the entire country. It claimed the lives of 40 paramilitary troopers when a suicide bomber rammed his car into a CRPF convoy. The tragic incident left such a huge impact that it can be seen in the numerous tributes that are being paid to the martyred jawans. The Indian music industry has a line-up of singles dedicated to them - while some songs released soon after the attack, there are still some more waiting in the wings. Here's a round-up of the musical projects and what went into making them.
Lata Mangeshkar, who doesn't sing so often these days, recorded a song called Saugandh Mujhe Is Mitti Ki, in March. Explaining how the track worked out, composer Mayuresh Pai says, "In 1962, during the Indo-China war, Lataji sang Ae Mere Watan Ke Logon. Having witnessed the Indian independence in 1947, Lataji grew up in an environment that resonated with the spirit of patriotism. The Pulwama attack moved her and that's when Saugandh Mujhe Is Mitti Ki was created."A week after the Pulwama terror attack in February, Bollywood playback singers Benny Dayal, Divya Kumar, Harshdeep Kaur, Nakash Aziz, Shalmali Kholgade, Shruti Pathak, Abhijeet Sawant, Aditi Singh Sharma, Abhijeet Bhattacharya, Ash King, Meenal Jain, Prajakta Shukre, Rana, Sohum Chakraborty, Amit Sana, Anusha Mani and Antara Mitra collaborated for a song, Darkhwast, which is dedicated to the soldiers who lost their lives in Pulwama. The music video also gives glimpses of the other terror attacks that took place in India in the past, including 26/11 and the 2006 Mumbai train bombings, among others. Singer Nakash, who conceived and composed the track, also co-wrote the lyrics with director-actor Roshan Abbas. He says, "The lyrics highlight that the world is in a state of shock. It's high time we stop thinking about the past and take care of the present and future." Singer Antara Mitra adds, "It's hard for so many singers to come together on such short notice, but I'm glad we managed. We had a lot to say and this track became a medium of expression for us."Sung by Sonu Nigam and Sukhwinder Singh, the song, Tu Desh Mera, is yet to release. Bollywood stars like Amitabh Bachchan, Aamir Khan, Ranbir Kapoor and Kartik Aaryan have already shot for the music video, while other actors are yet to shoot their parts.
Rendered by Bhojpuri actor-singer, Dinesh Lal Yadav aka Nirahua, Vyarth Nahi Jaaye Balidan Har Shaheed Ke is a rap number that released three days after the massacre on February 14. Needless to add, it went viral instantly.
Dr Palash Sen and Akriti Kakar recently collaborated on the song, Saajna. It is a Punjabi ballad dedicated to the Indian army and the martyred jawans of the Pulwama attack. The song, which released recently, depicts the love story of a soldier and how his duty towards the country means the most to him. Dr Sen says, "This song is a salute to the countless women and men who fight for our country and protect people like us. The video is also inspired by a true story. Most of the family members from my mother's side have served in the army. I know what it takes to do that job. I thought we should show the emotion and sacrifice that families of soldiers make." Akriti adds, "Saajna showcases the life of our jawans and how they leave their families and loved ones behind for the love of India. They are ready to sacrifice their lives for our country. This song is dedicated to them and their valour."Bhojpuri singer-actor Pawan Singh released a song, Pakistan Ko Ab Hum Dikhayenge, two days after the Pulwama incident. The music video shows scenes of the Indian army fighting the terrorists. The song has garnered over one million views online.

Srinagar, June 8 -- Four Jaish-e-Mohammad militants, including two special police officers (SPOs) who deserted the forces and signed up with the militant outfit, were killed in an overnight encounter with security forces in south Kashmir's Pulwama district, police said on Friday.
The forces launched a cordonand-search operation in Panjran in Litter area after getting inputs about the presence of militants there. An encounter ensued when the hiding militants fired on the search party on Thursday evening. "The forces returned fire, leading to an encounter. In the ensuing encounter, two listed terrorists and two SPOs who recently deserted the forces and became members of the proscribed terrorist organisation, JeM, were killed," said police spokesman Manoj Kumar.

Al-Qaeda anoints new chief for India wing
Peerzada Ashiq,

Srinagar,NATIONAL School dropout Hameed Lelhari will head the Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind Global terror outfit Al-Qaeda has announced a new chief for its India wing, the Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind (AGH), two weeks after its top ‘commander’ Zakir Musa was killed in an encounter in Pulwama’s Tral.
Hameed Lelhari alias Haroon Abbas will replace Musa and Ghazi Ibrahim Khalid will be his deputy, Abu Ubaidah Hafizahullah, a spokesman of the group made these claims in an 11-minute video released on the outfit’s official media handle al-Hurr on the occasion of Eid.
AGH chief Musa was killed in an operation on May 23 in Pulwama’s Tral. He had replaced slain militant ‘commander’ Burhan Wani in 2016, but quit the Hizb ul Mujahideen. His name first appeared in an Arabic publication close to al-Qaeda in May 2017.
The police suggested that the new chief Lelhari, 30, comes from a poor background, unlike Musa, and is a resident of Pulwama’s Lelhar area. Police records suggest Lelhari, after dropping out of school, took up small-time jobs as a labourer, cook and mason “to meet ends”.
However, his name did not figure in the list of top ten wanted militants complied by the Union Home Ministry recently. Hours after the declaration on the new AGH chief, Al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) spokesman Usama Mahmood, in another audio clipping, praised Musa in a bid to show global militants’ sympathy for him. This audio clipping was released by the outfit’s as-Sahab media group.
‘Saddened, mourning’
“Every militant in Afghanistan is saddened and mourning the killing of Musa... may Kashmir have many more Zakir Musas. Also, Muslims in Kashmir and other Muslims should take ahead the mission of Zakir Musa, Burhan Wani and Afzal Guru,” the spokesman said in the message released online.
Al-Qaeda social media platforms have also released a video on militant Faisal Ishfaq Bhatt, erstwhile resident of Srinagar and apparently in Afghanistan currently. “ Jihad in Kashmir is no different than jihad in Afghanistan.
The Al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent is counselling Afghan Taliban and also many jihadi s in Kashmir. Mujahideen and leaders of the AQIS are eager to meet their brethren in Kashmir. They will launch attacks on Army and Police,” the speaker, identified as Bhatt, says.

Jammu, June 7 -- A major plot by Pakistani spy agency Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) to revive militancy in Jammu region has been unearthed with the arrest of six persons from whom photographs and videos of strategic locations have been seized, officials said Friday.
The six spies were in direct contact with their handler, a colonel-level officer at ISI Kashmir cell, identified only by his first name Iftikhar, and with the terrorist group Hizb-ul-Mujahideen across the border, agency reports said.
Initially, two of the spies were arrested in May for shooting videos and taking photographs outside the Ratnuchak Military Station in Jammu. Militants have tried to target the sensitive military station, most recently in December when they opened fire on a sentry posted at an outpost.
During interrogation, Mushtaq Ahmed Malik (38), from Doda district, and Nadeem Akhter (24), from Kathua district, revealed to security officials that they were also being guided by their handlers in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.
They also disclosed information about four others engaged as Pakistani spies in Jammu region, officials said.
Based on that information, Saddam Hussain, Mohammad Saleem and Mohammad Shafi, all from Kathua district, and Safdar Ali, from Basantgarh in Udhampur district, were arrested, the officials said.
The spies revealed that they were tasked by the ISI officer to revive militancy in Jammu by recruiting youth in the region.
The Hizbul commanders guiding them were originally from Jammu region but had settled in Pakistan and PoK after joining active militancy.
Officials said the arrested persons belonged to three mountainous districts close to the International Border with Pakistan.
Security agencies are likely to arrest more persons linked to the spy ring who work as "over-ground workers".
Security officials have also found mobile phone numbers of their Pakistani handlers. They are trying to extract and retrieve mobile phone data as the spies are said to have to have deleted some data.

Gunmen killed Nigeena Bano whenshewastalkingtoavillager outside her house around 9am, residentssaid.The villager, who hasbulletwounds,isbattlingfor life in a hospital in Srinagar.
"#Terrorists fired on #civilianskillingagirlNigeenaBano& injuring another civilian Jalal u din Bafanda in #Pulwama.
#Police has registered a #case.
Officers are investigating circumstances of this #terrorcrime," the state police tweeted soon after the attack.
The victims were first rushed to a Pulwama hospital, where Bano, the mother of a 12-year-old boy, died. Bafanda was later taken for treatment to the state capital.
"We are shocked... unidentified gunmen came today and shot her outside our house, [which is] close to the local mosque where people were preparing for Eid prayers," said Bano's brother, Mohammad Shafi. No militant group has claimed responsibility for the raid that took place in the district where a suicide bomber killed 40 security personnel in an attack on a Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) convoy on February 14.
Bano was the third woman to be killed by unidentified gunmen in south Kashmir in the past year.
In separate incidents, four people suffered injuries in protests that erupted in several parts of the militancy-hit state, including Shopian and Anantnag towns, on the day of Eid festivities.
In Srinagar, the police used tear gas to disperse protesters who were allegedly carrying the flags of Pakistan and the Islamic State Jammu and Kashmir. A group of men took out a demonstration after Eid prayers at the Jamia Masjid, shouting slogans supporting slain militant leaders.
Security forces have killed 101 militants in counter-terror operations in the first five months of 2019. In 2018 and 2017, from January to May, security forces killed 70 and 57 militants, respectively.
Most counter-terror operations took place in Pulwama, Shopian, Kulgam and Anantnag in south Kashmir, which has emerged as the hotbed of militancy.
Hurriyat chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, who addressed a big gathering at Jamia Masjid, said the Kashmiri leadership could act as a bridge between India and Pakistan.
"This Eid we hope and pray for the early resumption of Indo-Pak dialogue," Mirwaiz said in his address.

Jaipur, June 6 -- Most children go to their grandparents' during summer vacation but Hemlata Gurjar and Mukesh Gurjar were hosted by a judge in Rajasthan's Pratapgarh as they took a break from school.
The children of Narayan Lal Gurjar, a CRPF jawan killed in Pulwama terror attack in February, were invited by Pratapgarh's district judge Rajendra Kumar Sharma and his wife Asha Sharma to their house for three days.
Hemlata, 14, and Mukesh, 12, came to Pratapgarh with their uncle, Mahesh, on June 2. The two said they had never been out of their village Binol in Rajsamand, a neighbouring district.
They were treated to delicacies made by Asha Sharma as well as street food and taken for sight-seeing and a film. They also went to Deepeshwar Pond and took rides at Woodland Park before going home on Tuesday evening.
"We had a lot of fun," they said adding they want to join the Indian Army when they grow up.
Gurjar was among the 40 soldiers who died during a terror attack on a Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) convoy in Jammu and Kashmir in February this year. Five of these soldiers were from Rajasthan.
Sharma visited each of the five grief-stricken families in the state and offered to look after the children of the soldiers killed in the worst terror attack in the restive state in decades.
"After the Pulwama tragedy, I visited families of all five CRPF soldiers from Rajasthan who lost their lives in the terror attack. I offered to look after their children, fund their studies and help the families in the wedding of girls," said the district judge.
The Sharmas have been inviting Gurjar's children to their house in Pratapgarh since their visit to the CRPF man's house in Binol.
"We are happy that the family accepted our offer and send the two children to us to spend some time here. They have come after finishing their exams. We looked after them like a good host. We had a good time hosting them; I am sure they had a good time, too, staying with us," said the judge's wife.
The district judge said he has invited children of all the five CRPF soldiers, killed in Pulwama, to his house. "They should feel that the country is with them," he said.
Sharma has a daughter and a son, who are law students and want to get into judicial services like their father.
After the Pulwama terror attack, Sharma had organised fund collection for the families of the slain soldiers and collected Rs.5 lakh. "I visited each of those families and donated Rs 1 lakh each as our way of saying that the country stands with people who lay down lives for it," the district judge said.

NEW DELHI, June 4 -- A Delhi court Tuesday sent separatists Masarat Alam, Asiya Andrabi and Shabir Shah to 10-day NIA custody in a terror funding case involving Jama'at-ud-Da'wah (JuD) chief Hafiz Saeed, the 2008 Mumbai terror attack mastermind, a lawyer said.
The National Investigation Agency arrested the three during in-chamber proceedings before Special Judge Rakesh Syal and sought 15-day custodial interrogation.
Asiya and Shah were already in custody in separate cases while Alam was brought from Jammu and Kashmir on transit remand, advocate MS Khan appearing for the accused told reporters.
NIA had filed a charge sheet in 2018 against Saeed, another terror mastermind Syed Salahuddin and 10 Kashmiri separatists in a case of alleged terror funding and secessionist activities in the valley.
It said that offences for which the accused have been chargesheeted include those punishable under sections 120B of IPC (criminal conspiracy) and various provisions of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967.
According to NIA, the case was registered on May 30, 2017 and the first arrests made on July 24 last year.
Earlier NIA brought separatist leader and alleged ringleader of stone pelting in Jammu and Kashmir Masrat Alam Bhat, from a state prison to Delhi to question him in connection with a terror funding case.
Bhat is the second separatist leader after Yasin Malik to be brought by the NIA here in connection with the case.
Bhat was shifted to Delhi's Tihar jail on Monday by a team comprising the NIA and the Jammu and Kashmir Police.
Later NIA produced Bhat before a special court here to seek his custody for interrogation in connection with the terror funding case which the agency registered in May 2017 after violence erupted in the Kashmir valley.
So far, the NIA has arrested several separatist leaders, including Aftab Hilali Shah alias Shahid-ul-Islam, Ayaz Akbar Khandey, Farooq Ahmad Dar alias Bitta Karate, Nayeem Khan, Altaf Ahmad Shah, Raja Mehrajuddin Kalwal and Bashir Ahmad Bhat alias Peer Saifullah.
Altaf Ahmad Shah is the son-in-law of Syed Ali Geelani, who advocates Jammu and Kashmir's merger with Pakistan. Shahid-ul-Islam is Dar's aide and Khandey is the spokesperson for the Geelani-led Hurriyat. Kashmiri businessman Zahoor Ahmad Shah Watali was arrested in August 2017.
The anti-terror agency, on January 18, 2018, filed a charge sheet against 12 persons, including Lashkar-e-Taiba founder Hafiz Saeed and Hizbul Mujahideen chief Syed Salahuddin in connection with the terror funding case.

"During the preceding night, state forces at a checkpoint on Shopian-Turkawangom road at Moolu Chitragam (in the south Kashmir district) intercepted a vehicle. However, the militants boarding the vehicle opened fire from inside on the forces," a police spokesman said.
He said the state forces retaliated and in the process, "one militant identified as Firdous Ahmad Bhat and an active associate Sajad Ahmad who was driving the vehicle got killed".
Both of them were residents of neighbouring Kulgam district, the spokesman said, adding another militant managed to flee taking advantage of the darkness.
The spokesman said according to police records, Bhat was a "listed militant".
The bodies have been handed over to their legal heirs after completion of medico-legal formalities, he said.
"Incriminating material, including arms and ammunition, were recovered from the spot. All these materials have been taken into case records for further investigation and to probe their complicity in other militantancy related crimes," the spokesman added.

Not halting ops in Valley during Ramzan helps rein in militancy

New Delhi, June 3 -- Ignoring the demand of Valley- based political parties to halt counterterror operations during Ramzan has reaped dividends. Security forces have neutralised 23 local and foreign militants in Kashmir during this period, taking the number killed in the counterterror drive to more than 100 in 2019.
This also resulted in largely peaceful congregations in the Valley during Jamat-ul-Vida, the last Friday before Eid next week.
Last year, due to the imposition of non-initiation of combat operations (NICO) in the Valley, only 11 militants were killed during the Ramzan month and that too on the Line of Control (LOC) in Kupwara and Handwara districts.
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) pulled out of its coalition government with the People's Democratic Party (PDP) on June 19, 2018, after the Eid-ul-Fitr festival, citing increased violence and radicalisation in the Valley.
Although PDP leader, Mehbooba Mufti, wanted the Centre to declare NICO during Ramzan this year, the Narendra Modi government ignored the call and turned up the heat on militants in the Kashmir Valley. Until Friday, 23 terrorists had been killed by the security forces in the Ramzan period, including Zakir Musa of Al Qaeda affiliate Ansar Ghazwat ul Hind. Others were gunned down in Shopian, Pulwama, Avantipora, Sopore, Kulgam and Anantnag areas of the Valley.
All the encounters were conducted on the basis of human intelligence that originated from the ground, according to senior home ministry officials.
While the security forces expect more encounters with local and foreign militants in June due to a rise in infiltration during summer months, the situation in the Valley has improved as militant numbers have gone down.
With no let-up in counterterror operations, security forces have ensured that foreign terrorists do not have a chance to regroup and plan during the Ramzan month.
Although Muslims largely keep the peace during the pious month, Pakistan-based terror groups use a different interpretation to launch attacks against India both in the state of Jammu and Kashmir and the hinterland.
The interpretation being that the crucial battle of Badr was fought by the Holy Prophet against the Quraish tribe of Mecca, which led to the rise of Islam in Saudi Arabia. Islamic radicalisers use this analogy to launch attacks against their enemies and hence some of the biggest terror attacks globally have taken place during the holy month.

Special Cell nipped 11 terror attacks in the bud in a year

New Delhi: In the past year, the Special Cell, Delhi Police’s anti-terror unit, carried out 11 major operations, four of them in the last four months. These were not limited to Delhi. The cell had forayed further afield, including to Jammu & Kashmir, Nepal border and north-east India.A Delhi Police document analysing these operations indicated that many of these, being preventive in nature, had nipped terror attacks in the bud. The unit is learnt to have provided major leads in solving the Pulwama attacks and also to have played important roles in wiping out an Islamic State (Jammu & Kashmir) module and nabbing terrorists belonging to Kangleipak Communist Part-Peoples War Group, a Manipur-based outfit.The Special Cell provided crucial inputs in the investigations of the Pulwama attacks that claimed the lives of 40 CRPF personnel after it arrested Sajjad Ahmed Khan, a resident of Tral living in Delhi under the disguise of a shawl trader, from Lajpat Rai market in March.
Khan proved to be a close associate of the mastermind, Mudasir Khan. His arrests helped the investigating agencies to identify and track all the perpetrators of the terror attack and eventually to their arrest. Two modules of the Hizb-ul-Mujahideen too were busted the same month.Ahead of Republic Day earlier this year, the unit also arrested two JeM cadres, Abdul Latif Ganaie and Hilal Ahmad Bhat, in the process foiling a terror attack in which the duo had planned to lob grenades in a crowded area.Last December, Delhi Police conducted a significant anti-terror operation in which three operatives of the Islamic State (J&K) were busted in a joint operation with the Jammu & Kashmir Police. The three men, Tahir Ali Khan, Haris Mushtaq Khan and Asif Suhail Nadaf, where detected hiding in an underground bunker in the middle of an apple orchard. They had attacked the police teams with a grenade when they approached the hideout.The arrests of SIMI operative Abdul Subhan Qureshi and Indian Mujahideen terrorist Ariz Khan in January last year were also important steps that dented IMs plans to revive its network in India. Khan was the chief executioner of the 2008 serial blasts in Delhi, Jaipur and Ahmedabad and UP court blasts in which 165 people had been killed.In an operation against terrorists from Manipur in September last year, the Special Cell arrested Oinam Ibochouba Singh, the self-styled acting chairman of KCP-PWG. A month before this, Moirangthem Rana Pratap, general secretary of the outfit, was also arrested from a hideout in Delhi. The Special Cell is currently headed by deputy commissioners of police Pramod Kushwah and Sanjeev Yadav.

32 foreigners among 100 militants killed in Kashmir in 5 months: Police

SRINAGAR, June 2 -- Over 100 militants were killed in "unrelenting operations" by security forces against various militant outfits in the Kashmir valley till May 31, police said on Saturday.
"Over 100 militants were killed by security forces in Kashmir till May 31," a police spokesman said. The killed militants included 25 foreign militants from various outfits. On an average, 20 militants were killed each month till May 31.
"This includes some top militant commanders and their cadre involved in the Pulwama terror attack of February 14, the attack on the Lethpora CRPF camp and other terrorist acts. "Some of the terrorist organisations like the Jaish-e-Muhammad have lost all its leadership and none of their ranks across the border are prepared to come and lead the outfit," the police spokesman said.
He said 52 security forces personnel also lost their lives this year till May 31, including the 40 CRPF jawans martyred in Pulwama terror attack on February 14. "Security forces including the army, the CRPF and state police, have been relentlessly carrying on anti-militancy operations with total synergy," he said, adding that this "hot pursuit has pushed the militants to remain constantly on the run." "They don't have the footholds like they had during the last four years, especially in south Kashmir districts of Pulwama, Anantnag, Shopian and Kulgam. They are on the run," he said.
Security forces have decided to continue pro-active operations across the Valley as their intelligence grid has remarkably improved. "After the imposition of the Governor's rule followed by President's rule in the state, reactive operations are few and far between. Non-interference in sensitive security issues by politicians has allowed the security forces to remain on the front foot," said a top intelligence officer, speaking on condition of anonymity.

SRINAGAR, June 2 -- Suspected militants on Sunday, in two separate incidents, hurled the grenades on the residences of National Conference and Congress leaders in Pulwama in south Kashmir.
This evening at around 5.00 PM, the suspected militants hurled grenades on the residence of National Conference leader Ghulam Mohi Ud din Mir in Muran village of Pulwama district. According to reports, the grenades exploded outside the compound wall and no loss of life was reported.
"The grenade exploded after hitting the compound wall with a deafening boom, causing no injuries or loss of life," an official informed. The police in this connection registered a case and started investigation.
Earlier in a similar incident, in the wee hours today, suspected militants attacked the house of a Congress leader in Pulwama in south Kashmir with hand grenades.
Two grenades were hurled at the house of Congress leader Omar Jan at Pinglana in Pulwama. The sound of a grenade explosion was heard in the entire area whereas another grenade fell but did not explode, the sources said.
People who were busy in special prayers rushed out from nearby mosques, suddenly on Shab-i-Qadar. Later bomb disposal squad (BDS) took away the unexploded grenade.
Jan, who is also a Panch, village Panchayat official, was not present in the house when attack took place. Family members of the Congress leader however, escaped unhurt, they said.
Later security forces conducted searches in the area but the attackers had escaped.
Last month, a local Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Gul Muhammad Mir was shot dead by suspected militants in Anantnag district. He was the party's district vice-president. According to reports, three militants came to his residence in Nowgam Verinag area and asked for his car keys. While they were driving the vehicle away, they shot Mir, who is popularly known as "Atal" in the area.

Over 100 militants killed, 50 new recruits in 2019

Srinagar, June 2 -- The first five months of 2019 have been far bloodier for militants in Kashmir than last year.
Over 100 militants, including 23 foreigners, have been killed in Kashmir in the first five months. Last year, during the same time, 66 militants were killed.
But what is keeping the security establishment worried is the large number of new recruits, officials said on Sunday.
According to them, 50 youngsters have joined various militant outfits since March and the security establishment "needs to find a better way to cut off the supply chain and can consider educating families on radicalisation of the youth."
The officials said 101 militants - 23 foreigners and 78 local militants - were killed in 2019 till May 31. They include top commanders such as Zakir Musa, the chief of Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind, a group affiliated with Al-Qaeda.
However, there is a sudden surge of militants from Hizbul Mujahideen joining Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind, especially after the elimination of Musa on May 23, they said.
The officials, many of whom are engaged in either fighting militancy on the ground or formulating strategy, believe there is a need for having a relook at the policy.
Among the militants killed, Shopian accounted for a maximum of 25, including 16 local militants. Pulwama was second with the killings of 15 militants, followed by Awantipora with 14 and Kulgam with 12.
However, all these highly-volatile areas in south Kashmir continue to contribute more youths to various militant groups. The officials said infiltration was also picking up and some of the militants had managed to sneak in from Poonch and Rajouri districts of Jammu region as well as from the LoC in Kashmir. This created a more alarming situation for the security forces which were readying themselves for the two-month-long Amarnath Yatra beginning this month-end.
There has been a steady rise in the number of youths taking up arms in the valley since 2014 onwards as compared to 2010-2013 when the figures stood at 54, 23, 21 and 6 respectively. In 2014, the number shot up to 53 and in 2015, it reached 66 before touching the highest mark of 88 in 2016, data presented in Parliament earlier showed.
After the February 14 militant strike in Pulwama, the officials feel, encounters between militants and security forces have turned into spectacles with protests and stone pelting by locals at sites, followed by large gatherings at funerals.
Recently, while talking to The Kashmir Monitor, Additional Director General of Police (ADGP), Law and Order, Muneer Khan said that precise information was leading to these encounters.
"We have not changed the strategy, we always want no or minimal damage during the encounters. It is good that if encounter breaks out in early hours as people won't face difficulties so as we," he said.

In 5 months, forces gun down 101 militants in Kashmir

Srinagar, June 2 -- Security forces have killed 101 militants in counterterror operations in the first five months of the year, acting on intelligences inputs provided by their informants on the ground.
In 2018 and 2017, from January to May, security forces had managed to kill 70 and 57 militants, respectively.
Most counter-terror operations were executed in south Kashmir's four districts - Pulwama, Shopian, Kulgam and Anantnag.
All four districts had seen a spike in militancy and militant recruitment after the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani by security forces in July 2016. "This year, the pace of operations has increased, especially in the hinterland areas, compared to previous years. The situation has improved in the areas which were considered hotbeds of militancy,'' said a senior police officer privy to details of anti-terror operations conducted in south Kashmir, requesting anonymity.
A majority of the 101 militants killed in the first five months were locals, the police said. "An average of 20 militants have been killed in each month so far. This includes 25 foreign terrorists and 76 locals, belonging to Jaish-eMohammad, Lashkar-e- Toiba, Hizbul Mujahideen and Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind,'' a J&K police spokesman said. On May 23, security forces gunned down the Valley's most wanted militant commander, Zakir Musa, 25, who had formed the Ansar Ghazwatul-Hind, an Al-Qaeda affiliate, in south Kashmir. Musa, who was active in South Kashmir's Tral area, was a close associate of Burhan Wani. After the killing of Burhan Wani, Musa parted ways with the Hizbul Mujahideen and formed his own group. After the killing of Musa, only a few militants of his groups still remain, the police said. Musa was killed in an operation launched on specific intelligence inputs. The killing triggered protests and stone throwing in the old city of Srinagar and in Pulwama, prompting the administration to suspend mobile internet services and impose a curfew in parts of the Valley for two days. In the past five months, up to seven militant commanders operating in various parts of south Kashmir were killed by security forces, the police said. One of them was Abid Manzoor Magray alias Sajju Tiger of the Hizb. The militant had been active since 2016.
A senior police officer said Hizbul operational commander Riyaz Naikoo was among the old guard of militants active in the south Kashmir. "Other old guard militants or commanders have been killed in various operations,'' the officer said on condition of anonymity. In the first five months, 61 troopers were killed by militants, and they included the 40 CRPF personnel who died in a suicide car bombing in Pulwama on February 14, which was followed by IAF strikes on a JeM terror camp in Balakot. The Jaish had claimed responsibility fort the Pulwama attack.

The hiding militants fired on the search party, leading to an encounter in which two listed militants along with the other one who was part of this group were killed, the spokesman said, adding that the bodies were handed over to their legal heirs.
The police, in a tweet, said the third individual "is considered to be an active associate of this group."
The slain militants were identified as Abid Manzoor Magray and Bilal Ahmad Bhat, both Pulwama residents, while the third man was Jasim Rashid Shah, from Malnar in Shopian. Police said the group was affiliated to the proscribed outfit Hizbul Mujahideen.

The bodies were retrieved from the site of encounter, the police said, adding that the identities and affiliation of the slain militants were being ascertained.
This is sixth encounter in Kashmir since Tuesday in which six militants were killed besides an alleged militant associate and a civilian. Two Lashkar-e-Taiba(LeT) militants were gunned down on Thursday at Sopore in north Kashmir's Baramulla district, police said.
The incident followed after two encounters on Wednesday in Shopian and Kulgam districts in Jammu and Kashmir in which a civilian was killed and 80 others were injured in clashes. The militants had managed to escape.
On Tuesday, two militants affiliated with the Pakistan-based terror outfit JeM were killed in an encounter in south Kashmir's Anantnag. Last week , security forces gunned down Valley's most wanted militant commander Zakir Musa, 25, who had formed Al Qaeda affiliate Ansar Gazwat-ul-Hind, in south Kashmir.

New Delhi, May 31 -- The National Investigation Agency (NIA), which is looking into the March 30 failed car bombing attack on a Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) convoy in Banihal, Jammu & Kashmir, has revealed that terror group Hizbul Mujahideen (HM) was behind it, and that it was inspired by another terror group, Jaish-e-Mohammed's February 14 Pulwama bombing, according to two officials aware of developments in the investigation.
The two officials, neither of whom wanted to be identified, added that the terror group thought the attack would "give international recognition" to it.
The agency learnt about the conspiracy during the questioning of the HM terrorists, including Hilal Ahmad Mantoo, Owais Amin (who drove the car into the CRPF convoy), Umar Shafi, Aqib Shah, Shahid Wani and Wasim Ahmed Dar.
They were arrested by the Jammu and Kashmir police after the attack.
An NIA officer said that Mantoo, a PhD student from Central University of Punjab who is believed to be close to the HM commander in South Kashmir, Dr Saifullah, was also confronted last week with overground workers (OGWs) of the outfit, identified as Mushtaq Ahmad Malik, Zakir Hussain Mir, Rafiq Ahmad Magray and Alam Bhat.
"Most of them have claimed they received orders from the top brass of HM that the outfit needs to do something like Jaish did in Pulwama. They locally assembled a bomb using gelatin sticks, urea, ammonium nitrate, LPG cylinders and few other chemicals but it was not a perfect bomb. They say they wanted to gain international headlines so that Pakistan-based leader of HM Syed Salahuddin is praised in that country," said the NIA officer.
The incident happened on March 30, one-and-a-half months after the Pulwama attack, in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed by a Jaish bomber. India responded 12 days later with an air strike on a Jaish facility in Balakot, Pakistan. At several points in those weeks, India and Pakistan were close to war. In the HM attack, a Santro car laden with explosives hit a CRPF bus around 10 am when the convoy was moving from Srinagar to Jammu. Nobody was injured in the incident.
"The Hizbul has not been able to carry out any major attack in Kashmir valley in the last three years since a concerted crackdown by the security forces. Their space has been occupied by JeM, which has mostly Pakistan-based cadres, so HM members were desperate to revive the group by doing something on the same lines. They could not carry it off," a second NIA officer said.
The central anti-terror probe agency is trying to find out if any JeM members were involved in the Banihal attack.

SRINAGAR, May 31 -- Two local militants, affiliated with Lashker-e-Taiba, were killed in an encounter with Sopore town of north Kashmir's Baramulla district.
"On a credible input, a cordon and search operation was launched jointly by police and (govermment) forces in Dangerpora area of Sopore," a police spokesman said.
During the search operation, he said, the hiding militants fired on the search party. "The fire was retaliated leading to an encounter," he said.
In the ensuing encounter, he said, two militants were killed and the bodies were retrieved from the site of encounter.
A police officer identified them as Asif Ahmad War of Warpora Sopore and Naseer Ahmad Mir of Braath Sopore. "Both of them were affiliated with LeT outfit," he added.
Incriminating material including arms and ammunition was recovered from the site of encounter, the officer said.
Meanwhile thousands of people participated in funeral prayers of the duo at their respective native villages. Reports said people from many villages participated in the funeral prayers of both slain.
1000's Attend Shopian Civilian's Last Rites
The government forces on Thursday called off the search operation as there was no militant found present at Gugloora area of Pinjura in south Kashmir's Shopian district.
A civilian was killed and several others were injured in government forces action during a cordon-and-search operation late Wednesday evening at Gugloora.
Locals said that government forces resorted to teargas shelling, pellets and live ammunition to disperse the protesters. Sajad Ahmad Parray son of Ali Mohd Parray of Buderhama village along with several others sustained critical injuries and were taken to district hospital Shopian.
Sajad was declared brought dead on arrival by the doctors at the hospital, they said.
Some other critically injured persons were referred to Srinagar hospital for specialized treatment, they said.
Meanwhile, the joint team of army's 44 RR, SOG and CRPF carried searches in the village but there was no militant present following which the operation has been called off. The situation in the area was tense, local sources said.
A police officer said that operation has been called off in the area and investigations would be done to ascertain facts as regards the killing of civilian and injuries to others.
"The probe will encompass circumstances leading to use of force," the officer added.
Meanwhile, thousands of people participated in the funeral prayers of the civilian Sajad Ahmad Parray. There was also strike in the district with shops and other business establishments closed and traffic off the roads.

Why Imran Khan was never going to be a guest of honour at Modi's second swearing in
Indrani Bagchi
756 words
31 May 2019

There was never any possibility, really, that Imran Khan would be a guest at Narendra Modi's second swearing-in. Pakistan-sponsored terrorism, Pulwama and Balakot played a big role in the 2019 election campaign, and contributed enormously towards Modi's second coming. Modi has sought and received a massive mandate for his tough line with Pakistan.
Second, Modi has burnt his fingers here before. The apparent affection between Modi and Nawaz Sharif in 2014 did nothing to further the cause of peace between India and Pakistan. Modi's impulsive Santa Claus act at Nawaz Sharif's birthday was followed by the Pathankot terror attack. In the past few years, Pakistan has not let up on terror against India.
So Bimstec was a convenient option. But on a larger scale, the move to delegitimise Saarc and redefine India's immediate neighbourhood by looking eastwards, rather than being stuck in a relationship where Pakistan enjoyed a veto, has been going on for a few years now.
If in the past couple of years the surgical strikes and Balakot air strikes can be seen as bookends, India has put the squeeze on Pakistan in a number of ways, bilaterally as well as diplomatically. This has ranged from shutting off MFN, full utilisation of its share of Indus waters, stepping up ties with Pakistan's closest friends in the Gulf. India even made a deal with China to put Pakistan on the FATF grey list! India breached the OIC barrier and engaged with that body at the highest levels. A tougher US administration has been on the Indian side of the argument, a fact that helped UNSC bend the Chinese to ban Masood Azhar.
Modi 2.0 will not be a softer Modi - he may speak softer, but India in the next five years is likely to continue to squeeze Pakistan in every way possible.
In the next couple of weeks, Modi will most likely meet Imran in Bishkek on the sidelines of the SCO summit. That should not be seen as the first step towards restarting dialogue. The best we can hope for is an NSA-level dialogue. What will India be looking out for?
At the FATF meeting in Florida scheduled to take place soon after the SCO summit, India will join the chorus to put Pakistan into the blacklist. At the very least, Pakistan is likely to stay in the greylist. In the past few weeks Pakistan has tried to take some steps to avoid the blacklist, but these might be too little too late. India would be looking for systemic changes in Pakistan that finally begins to reject the principle of using terrorism as a foreign policy tool. The Indians were inept at providing visual evidence of Balakot, but that it happened and caused significant damage there is no doubt. No matter what their public stance, Pakistan knows it. They are also beginning to realise that Modi is unpredictable enough to do it differently next time. That there will be a next time is equally without doubt.
India will look out for Pakistan ceasing what officials call "subversive activities" in the Kashmir valley - this is less visible but more insidious, including cash transfers, sabotage, intimidation, etc. This will require more work by the Indian security system.
On the LoC and boundary, the guns will not fall silent. Security forces have taken an aggressive response to infiltration and it's unlikely to soften. Ajit Doval has led a drive to flush out militants in the Srinagar valley and successfully silenced the Hurriyat, thereby reducing the workload in the Pakistan high commission in New Delhi. Going forward, this will intensify. Where Modi 2.0 is likely to focus is in its approach to Jammu & Kashmir. An economic development initiative has started and will get more energy, certainly in the run-up to the assembly elections, which will happen sooner rather than later.
A bigger hearts and minds exercise to address the alienation inside Kashmir will need to be addressed, certainly if the Modi government wants to create conditions to repeal Article 35A and 370 that BJP has sworn it will do. Imran and Gen Bajwa will have to chew on this. In the first years of his first term, Modi wanted to do a deal with Pakistan.
Modi's victory this time has raised the bar for engagement with Pakistan. Modi will want much more from Pakistan.

Srinagar, May 31 -- Two Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) militants were killed in a gunfight with security forces on Thursday at Sopore in north Kashmir's Baramulla district, police said.
Acting on a tip-off, a joint party of police, army and CRPF had launched a search and cordon operation in Dangerpora area of Sopore which was followed by the encounter.
During the search operation, the hiding militants fired on the search party to which they retaliated, a police spokesperson said.
"In the ensuing encounter, two terrorists were killed and their bodies were retrieved from the site of encounter," the spokesman said.
Incriminating material, including arms and ammunition, was recovered from the site of encounter.
The police identified the two militants as Naseer Ahmad Mir alias Tawseef of Brath Kalan, Sopore and Asif Ahmad War of Warpora, Sopore.
"As per police records, the duo was affiliated with proscribed terror outfit LeT and were wanted by law for their complicity in a series of terror crimes, including attack on security establishments and civilian atrocities," the police spokesman said.
Naseer had a history of terror crime records since 2017. He was part of groups involved in planning and executing series of militant attacks in the area and many other civilian atrocities.
Police have requested the residents of the area to not venture inside the encounter zone suspecting the presence of stray explosives.
Authorities have suspended mobile internet services in Sopore and also closed some educational institutions as a precaution. The incident follows another encounter on Wednesday in Shopian district in Jammu and Kashmir in which a security personnel and a civilian were also killed. On Tuesday, two militants affiliated with the Pakistan-based terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) were killed in an encounter in south Kashmir's Anantnag.
Last week , security forces gunned down Valley's most wanted militant commander Zakir Musa, 25, who had formed Al Qaeda affiliate Ansar Gazwat-ul-Hind, in south Kashmir.
The killing had triggered protests and stone pelting in old city Srinagar and in Pulwama prompting administration to suspend mobile internet and impose curfew in parts of Valley for two days. Educational institutions had also remained closed.
On May 22, two Hizbul Mujahideen militants were killed in a gunfight with security forces in south Kashmir's Kulgam district.
Post peaceful conduct of the Lok Sabha elections, the frequency of gunfights have increased in Kashmir valley, so has the number of militant deaths since May 10. There were just four encounters between the security forces and militants between April 11 when Baramulla voted in the first phase of general elections and May 6 when the polls ended in the Valley. A total of 94 militants have been killed in various encounters across Kashmir so far this year.

NIA team in Sri Lanka to brief about probe

Jammu, May 30 -- A two-member team of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) is in Sri Lanka to hold discussions with authorities about a probe in the Easter Sunday bombings over claims that some terrorists, owning allegiance to ISIS, had travelled to India, including Kashmir, officials said today.
The National Investigation Agency (NIA) team is led by Inspector General Alok Mittal, who has probed various ISIS-related cases in South India, including a conspiracy by the terror module to kill prominent leaders.
During investigations in the case, the NIA had alerted the island nation that ISIS terrorists were planning to carry out strikes there. India had been regularly sharing intelligence inputs about a possible terror attack in Sri Lanka targeting the Indian High Commission and religious places there.
The inputs to Sri Lanka were sent through diplomatic channels after a thorough investigation pertaining to the ISIS case in Coimbatore was carried out by the NIA, which has filed a charge sheet against seven people.
The Indian delegation will give a detailed briefing about its probe during which it had stumbled upon videos of National Thowheed Jamaat (NTJ) leader Zahran Hashim, which was indicative of a terror attack on religious places as well as the Indian High Commission in Colombo.
Zahran Hashim was among the nine suicide bombers, including a woman, who carried out a series of blasts in Sri Lanka in which 253 people were killed on April 21.
The videos, seized from the accused in the Coimbatore case, showed Zahran Hashim asking youngsters from Sri Lanka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala to establish an Islamic rule in the region.
After the blasts in Sri Lanka, the NIA had arrested 29-year-old Riyas A, also known as Riyas Aboobacker or Abu Dujana, a resident of Palakkad. He was alleged to be in touch with Zahran Hashim on social media platforms, the officials said.
The accused had disclosed during investigations that he had been following speeches of Zahran Hashim for more than a year and has also followed the speeches delivered by controversial Islamic preacher Zakir Naik.
According to inputs with the central agencies, Zahran Hashim had spent time in India last year during which he attempted to influence youngsters in Tamil Nadu and Kerala to join him.
Zahran Hashim had parted ways from Sri Lankan National Thowheeth Jamaat (NTJ) to form his own outfit Nation of Thowheed Jamaat which is alleged to have carried out the Easter attacks in Sri Lanka.
The team will also ask about the claims made by Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake, the commander of the Sri Lankan Army, that the suicide bombers had travelled to some cities in India, including Kashmir.
"They (the suspects) have gone to India, they have gone to Kashmir, Bangalore, they have travelled to Kerala state. Those are the information available with us," he had said to BBC earlier this month.
However, the Jammu and Kashmir police had denied the report and asked the Sri Lanakan authorities to share more information about it.

Jammu, May 30 -- Over 50 persons were injured in clashes between protestors and security forces near an encounter site at Mohammadpora village of southern Kulgam district today.
The gunfight had raged in Mohammadpora village of Kulgam at the crack of dawn after the forces threw a ring of cordon around the village following a credible input about the presence of militants.
As soon as the firefight broke out in weeks hours, local sources said, people mostly youth assembled near the spot and pelted the forces with stones in a bid to disrupt the operation.
"Clashes intensified as the number of protesters kept growing," locals said. Forces during the clashes fired pellets and tear-smoke shells and live ammunition leaving more than fifty protesters injured.
Facing intense stone throwing, forces, locals said, blasted the house and carried out massive searches to locate the bodies of militants.
To clear the way for bulldozers up to the house for removing the debris, forces, a local source said, cut down around a dozen apple trees belonging to the house owner.
However, as the forces left the spot after finding nothing from under the debris of the destroyed house, protesters who had converged in thousands near the spot rushed towards the house and retrieved a militant alive from the debris.
A local source said the militant after being found alive by the people soon disappeared.
His other associates are believed to have escaped only with the start of encounter under the cover of darkness.
An official said they had information about two to three militants in the area.
"Since we could not find the body of any militant there is possibility of militants having escaped," the official said.

ISIS Ideology Killed Along With Zakir Musa: DGP

Copyright 2019. Kashmir Observer.
POONCH, May 29 -- Director General of Police (DGP) Kashmir Dilbagh Singh Tuesday said that the killing of Zakir Musa has marked the end of ISIS in Kashmir. He also said that the ideology of the global militant group was "unacceptable" to Kashmir.
DGP was addressing police personnel at District Police Lines Rajouri and Poonch during his visit to the twin districts.
He was accompanied by IGP Vijay Kumar and DIG Rajouri-Poonch Range Vivek Gupta. The visit was part of the series of his visits to the districts of Jammu Zone.
Earlier, DGP visited Kishtwar, Bhaderwah, Gool, Mahore, Reasi and Udhampur districts of Jammu Zone.
Responding to the question on the killing of Ansar Ghazwatul Hind (AGH) chief Zakir Rashid Bhat alais Zakir Musa, DGP said Musa was spreading a new idea of militancy.
"He was propagating ISIS ideology,"Singh said.
"Musa tried hard to mislead people but with the efforts of police, the supporters were crushed and at last he was killed," he said.
Claiming that the number of militants is decreasing in the Valley, Singh said there are 275 militants active of which 100 to 115 are foreign. Earlier the number would increase but with back to back killings the number has decreased, he said.
"We also succeeded in stopping infiltration this year which resulted in less foreigners reaching this side," Singh added.
Singh on the occasion congratulated forces for smooth conduct of recently held elections and hailed them for their efforts against drug menace in Kashmir.
"Drug peddlers should be booked under PSA to curb their malpractices and bring them to justice," he said.
He said drug abuse is harmful to society and the Jammu and Kashmir Police would make all possible efforts to tighten the noose against all those indulging in the trade and transportation of narcotic substances.
"Drug abuse has become a big challenge for society and the police force is putting in hard work to eliminate the menace. The peddlers should be booked under the PSA to curb their malpractices and bring them to justice," he said.
Musa's father urges unity
Father of slain Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind chief Zakir Musa has asked people to remain united, saying he always wanted his son to stay away from controversies.
Addressing mourners at his Noorpora residence in Tral, Abdul Rashid Bhat said whether people agree or disagree, "we have to invite people towards a particular cause, but we should do it without any quarrels."
"Please don't get divided," he was quoted as saying by a local news agency. Musa's father said that "enemy is always looking for an opportunity to divide us". "We've already been divided into different sects, now they are dividing us into groups," he said.
"Every militant is dear to us. His only aim is to satisfy Allah, irrespective of his group affiliation. But we create issues over these things also. Please don't do it. All Mujahideen are equal for us, irrespective of groups, colour, qualification and region," he said.

SRINAGAR, May 29 -- Two Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) terrorists, including a Pakistani national, were killed on Tuesday in an encounter with security forces in the forests of Jammu and Kashmir's Anantnag district, police said.
A police official said one of the slain militants was identified as Faisal Nazir Mir, a resident of Anantnag, and incriminating materials recovered at the site of the encounter revealed that the other was a Pakistani citizen.
As per the police records, both were affiliated with the JeM, the official said, adding that Mir had joined the outfit recently. "The Pakistani terrorist, as per the police records, was involved in conspiring and executing a series of terror attacks on security establishments and many other civilian atrocities. He was wanted by the law for his complicity in a series of terror crimes, and several terror crime cases were registered against him," the spokesman said. The gunfight started after forces received an input about presence of militants following which a joint party of police, army and CRPF launched a search operation in Kachwan forest of Kokernag in Anantnag.
"During the search operation, the hiding terrorists fired on the search party. The firing was retaliated, leading to an encounter. In the ensuing encounter, 2 terrorists were killed and the bodies were retrieved from the site of encounter," a police spokesman said. Last week on the intervening night of Thursday and Friday, security forces killed Kashmir's most wanted militant commander Zakir Musa, 25, who had formed Al Qaeda affiliate Ansar Gazwat-ul-Hind, in south Kashmir.
The killing had triggered protests and stone pelting in old city Srinagar and in Pulwama, prompting the administration to suspend mobile internet and impose curfew in parts of Valley for two days. Educational institutions had also been closed. On Wednesday, two Hizbul Mujahideen militants were killed in a gunfight with security forces in south Kashmir's Kulgam district.

Jammu, May 29 -- Director general of police(DGP) Dilbagh Singh on Tuesday said that militant Zakir Musa'a killing is death of caliphate idea.
"It was propagated that Musa was working on an ideology of so called-Islamic State (IS) and will claim Caliphate. The idea died with his death, though he tried hard to recruit more number of youths within the Valley and other areas, but he could not succeed. All of his accomplices have been neutralised by the police and army on different occasions. He was the lone survivor who too was killed by joint forces last week," the DGP said during his visit to Poonch on Tuesday.
The DGP said that J&K police is achieving success against terrorism for which the force has been praised at national-level.
Musa who headed the Ansar Gazwatul Hind was killed last week by the security forces in Pulwama's Dadsara village.
"There are total 275 militants active in the state, including 125 foreign militants and it is a matter of satisfaction that the number is coming down. Earlier, even after eliminating militants, their number use to remain more or less the same as positions there were either filled by Pak-based militants or locals. Now, in last five months, only 40 locals have taken up the arms and the number is less than half as compared to past trend", the DGP said.htc

SRINAGAR: The killer of rifleman Aurangzeb was among four Hizbul Mujahideen terrorists gunned down in two encounters in Kashmir Valley on Saturday.
Aurangzeb, a soldier of 44-RR, was kidnapped and shot dead by terrorists on June 14 last year when he was on his way from Shadipora in Shopian district to his village in Poonch in a private vehicle to attend a family function.While three of the terrorists, including the killer of the soldier, were gunned down at Panzgam in Awantipora of south Kashmir’s Pulwama district, the fourth one was killed at Hathlangoo in north Kashmir’s Sopore.Awantipora SSP Tahir Saleem said the three terrorists killed at Panzgam have been identified as Showkat Ahmad Dar of Panzgam, Irfan Ahmad of Sopore and Muzzafar Ahmad of Tahab Pulwama, all affiliated to Hizbul Mujahideen.Saleem said Showkat Dar was “directly involved” in the killing of Aurangzeb, who was part of a team that had killed Hizbul commander Sameer Tiger on May 1 last year.The Panzgam encounter broke out in the wee hours of Saturday. An official said a joint team of forces, including Army’s 55-RR and SOG, cordoned off Bonpora Panzgam after credible inputs about the presence of some terrorists in the area. As the forces closed in on the suspected hideout of the terrorists, they were fired upon. The forces retaliated, leading to the encounter and subsequent killing of the three terrorists.The second encounter took place after security forces cordoned off Hathlangoo on Saturday afternoon after getting information about the presence of terrorists there. “During the search operation, the hiding terrorists fired on the search party. The fire was retaliated, leading to an encounter in which one terrorist was killed,” a police spokesman said.“The body of the slain terrorist, identified as Waseem Ahmad Naik of Udipora village in Pulwama district, was retrieved from the encounter site. Naik too belonged to the Hizbul Mujahideen. Search operation in the area continues,” he said, adding that it was a clean operation and no collateral damage took place during the exchange of fire.Soon after news of the encounters spread, youths took to the streets and started pelting stones on security forces, which was retaliated by teargas shelling. Several youths received minor injuries during the clashes, reports said.

My sons were used as human shield: Father of slain youth

SRINAGAR: The father of the civilian killed during an encounter late on Thursday night in Pulwama district has accused security forces of “using his sons as human shields”.Brothers Rayees and Younis Ahmed Dar were dragged out of their house late Thursday night (May 16) by security forces as the family prepared for 'sehri’ at about 2.30am, Jalaluddin Dar has said.He said Army men used his sons to flush out militants holed up in a neighbouring house that belonged to Ghulam Hassan Dar. “My wife, my daughter-in-law, and I… we tried to resist but the soldiers forced me as well out of my home,” the 67-year-old said.Jalaluddin recalled to TOI, “I told them I will come with you, let my sons go, but they paid no heed. The soldiers took my sons in different directions and I was taken in another direction.
The soldiers ordered my sons to ask our neighbours to come out of their houses.”Younis, who was also hurt but survived, said, “No sooner had my brother Rayees knocked on the door of the house just next to ours, that another man, his face masked, told Rayees and me to go to the house of Ghulam Hassan Dar, which is the third house from ours.“I was a little distance away. The moment Rayees knocked on Ghulam Hassan’s door and asked them to come out, lights in the house went out. Gunshots were heard from inside. This perhaps killed the soldier from the search party. In the exchange of fire, my brother was killed and I received a bullet on the thigh,” Younis said, adding he tried to crawl away but his brother was killed on the spot.In Thursday’s encounter, security forces killed two Jaish terrorists at Dalipora village, in south Kashmir’s Pulwama district. A police officer had initially said three soldiers and two civilians, brothers Younis and Rayees Ahmad Dar were injured. But Rayees died at the encounter site, and his brother Younis was taken to a nearby hospital from where he was referred to a Srinagar hospital, the officer said. All three terrorists were killed.Jalaluddin added: “The soldiers ordered me to lift an army man who I carried on my back till some 200 yards away from the encounter site though it was still dangerous.”J&K Police have denied the family’s claim. “As police and security forces were evacuating civilians from the neighbourhood area around the target house, the hiding militants fired indiscriminately. In the process, one Army jawan Sepoy Sandeep was killed and one civilian Rayees Dar also lost his life,” a police statement said.Jalaluddin said there was no police or paramilitary force, but that “it was Army men who took my sons as human shields”. Rayees, on completion of an MBA from a Srinagar college, was studying Islamic banking in an online course, his family said. Younis’s wife Firdousa recalled: “It was a fearful sight when my father-in-law was pleading with the soldiers to take him instead of his two sons.”A senior officer told TOI J&K Police could probe the allegation.

Former HC Judge Says, Access To Justice Denied in Kashmir

Copyright 2019. Kashmir Observer.
SRINAGAR, May 18 -- Former High Court Judge Justice (Retd) Hasnain Masoodi on Saturday demanded government to repeal of SROs 149 and 313, saying fundamental right of access to justice is being denied to people in every nook and corner of the Kashmir Valley.
As per SRO-149 of 2019 and SRO-313 of 2019, the cases of the people detained under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and Prevention of Terrorist Act have been ordered to be dealt with exclusively by a special court at Srinagar.
"As a consequence, those detained in every nook and corner of the Kashmir Valley is perforce made to come to Srinagar (special court). This means that access to justice which is a fundamental right is denied to them," Justice (retd) Masoodi, who is National Conference's candidate from Anantnag Parliamentary seat told reporters.
"Youth from far-flung areas like Chatergul, Larnoo or other places are made to visit the special court at Srinagar. I demand that both SRO 149 and SRO 313 of 2019 be rescinded and sessions judge in every district shall be given the power to try such cases so that youth who have been implicated or facing such charges get justice within their own district and getting justice is not delayed rather does not become impossible as is the case presently," he said.
He said UAPA is wide-ranging Act and even uttering a word can be encompassed in its domain.
"A case has come to my notice wherein a youth got bail after one month but instead of releasing him, he has been booked in 2017 case and he again has to go to Srinagar for the report."
Asked whether National Conference would do away with such laws, Masoodi responded in affirmative.
"The vice president of our party Omar Abdullah has already announced that Public Safety Act and other such acts will be repealed and only ordinary laws shall remain in force," he said, adding, "The Constitution provides for justice and access to justice and that access is being denied."
Justice (retd) Masoodi said that government has to be conscious about the ground realities and both these SROs should be repealed and sessions judges given powers to try such cases as was the case before March 2019. "Not only is the special court overcrowded, there is also a prolonged delay in getting justice and we will launch a struggle so that people get justice."

Puri doesn't bank on BJP hypernationalism

Amritsar, May 18 -- In the Lok Sabha election campaign that ended on Friday, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders raised national security issues including Balakot airstrike to woo voters in Amritsar, much like their colleagues elsewhere in the country. Hardeep Singh Puri, BJP candidate from Amritsar, however, chose to avoid them.
Puri, who is also the Union minister of state (independent charges) for housing and urban affairs, hardly talked about the airstrike by the Indian Air Force carried out in Balakot (Pakistan) post Pulwama terror attack that killed 44 CRPF personnel in Jammu and Kashmir in February this year.
Throughout his poll campaign, Puri sought votes listing development projects and welfare schemes launched by the Modi government. In a rally attended by BJP national president Amit Shah here on May 12, he and other senior party leaders including national secretary Tarun Chugh glorified Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the issue of Balakot. Puri, however, did not even touch it.
Instead, he advocated normalisation along the Indo-Pak international border. Tension prevailed along the border with Pakistan after Pulwama attack. Besides, the Union government also suspended Indo-Pak trade through the Attari-Wagah border, that created problems for traders and workers whose livelihood depends on this trade.
Taking note of this, Puri said, "I will work for removal of difficulties being faced by traders and workers whose life has been adversely affected by the temporary closure of Attari border trade with Pakistan."
As per political pundits, the Balakot airstrike was not an important issue for border states like Punjab. Unlike other BJP leaders who raised the issue of 1984 anti-Sikh riots but rarely touched Operation Bluestar, Puri talked about the latter, especially in rural segments which are Sikh dominated.

Srinagar, May 18 -- A shutdown was observed in Kashmir on Friday following the call by the separatists to protest against the killing of a civilians following encounters between militants and security forces in Pulwama district on Thursday.
Most of the shops, businesses and educational institutions remained closed in Srinagar. Public transport was off the roads, but a few private cars, cabs and auto-rickshaws were seen plying in some areas of the city.
The attendance in government offices was also thin.
The separatist, under the banner of Joint Resistance Leadership (JRL), had called for the shutdown against the "gruesome killings of innocent civilians Arshad Ahmad Dar (Pattan), Raies Ahmad Dar (Pulwama) and Nayeem Ahmad Shah (Baderwah) at the hands of Indian occupation forces even during the ongoing holy month of Ramadan".
They had also called for a protest march after Friday prayers across the state and appealed youth to maintain peace and discipline while leading the protests.
Authorities had imposed restrictions in parts of the old city to prevent the protests. There was heavy deployment of police and CRPF in sensitive areas. "We had imposed restrictions in some parts of downtown (old city) and everything remained peaceful. There was a stray incident of stone-pelting in Gawakadal," said Srinagar senior superintendent of police Haseeb Mughal. The Friday prayers could not be held in old city's Jamia Masjid Srinagar due to restrictions.
"There is no let up in the bloodbath even in Ramazan while CASOs have been intensified, harassment, intimidation, and house to house searches of homes increased which stands as an eye opener for the world community and the international rights organisations as to what people of Kashmir are going through," the Hurriyat Conference(M) said.
Five militants, one of their associates, a civilian and two soldiers were killed in two separate encounters in Pulwama and Shopian districts of south Kashmir on Thursday.
On Wednesday, Arshid Ahmad Dar, a youth from Pattan who was injured during clashes with security forces on Monday during a protest against the rape of a 3-year-old girl, succumbed to his injuries on Wednesday.
The 40-year-old Nayeem Ahmad Shah was killed in Bhaderwah in a firing incident on Thursday, prompting authorities to impose curfew there.

Jammu, May 18 -- Jammu and Kashmir's Kishtwar and adjoining areas on Friday observed a shutdown over killings of BJP and RSS functionaries in the recent past.
Senior RSS functionary Chanderkant Sharma and his security guard were killed by militants inside Kishtwar district hospital on April 9. Earlier, senior BJP leader Anil Parihar and his brother Ajeet Parihar were killed in a militant attack in Kishtwar on November 1 last year.
Days after the killing of RSS leader, the night curfew in the town still remains in force. Further prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the CrPC banning assembly of more than four persons also continues in the town and adjoining areas as a precautionary measure.
On Friday, the town wore a deserted look owing to the bandh call by Sanatan Dharam Sabha, an organisation of Hindus, to protest against the administration over their failure to nab the culprits responsible for both the killings. Most of the shops and business establishment remained shut. Majority of the public transport was off the roads, but a few private cars, cabs and auto-rickshaws were seen plying in some areas of the city.HTC
